1
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,345
First Ranger, you have
command of Castle Black.

2
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,781
Lord Commander,
it is my duty to tell you

3
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,318
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

4
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,353
and an insult
to all the brothers

5
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,456
who have died
fighting the wildlings.

6
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,360
As always, thank you
for your honesty.

7
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,202
Safe travels, Lord Commander.

8
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,637
Thank you, Sam.

9
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,006
Oh, um...

10
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:33,979
It's dragonglass.

11
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:37,182
It's what I used
to kill the white walker.

12
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,223
I hope you don't need them.

13
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,692
Me, too.

14
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,275
Yah.

15
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,792
There he is.

16
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,699
That laugh.

17
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,002
<i>Egg.

18
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,837
<i>Egg laughed like that.

19
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,275
<i>One of the first things
I remember.

20
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:43,315
His little brother Aegon.
He became king.

21
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:48,654
And before that,
he was a jolly fellow,

22
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,656
like this one.

23
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:59,698
Get him south, Gillyflower.

24
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,669
Before it's too late.

25
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,084
( gasps )

26
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,454
Theon, wait.

27
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:58,123
Not Theon, my lady. Reek.

28
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,425
Help me.

29
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,862
You're his wife now.

30
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,931
Theon.

31
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:06,998
<i>Do what he says.

32
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,467
Do what he says
or he'll hurt you.

33
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:11,436
He already hurts me every night.

34
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,804
All day I'm locked in this room

35
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,774
and every night he comes...

36
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,144
It can't be any worse.

37
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:23,782
It can. It can always be worse.

38
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,458
- What did he do to you?
- Please.

39
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,595
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

40
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,797
You have to help me.
Theon, help me.

41
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,033
He'll see us.
You don't know him.

42
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,368
My family still has
friends in the North.

43
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,972
All I need to do is give a
signal and they'll rescue me.

44
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,474
Climb to the top
of the broken tower.

45
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,676
Light this candle
and put it in the window.

46
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:55,280
- Promise me, Theon.
- Reek! My name is Reek.

47
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:00,952
Your name is Theon Greyjoy.

48
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,889
Last surviving son
of Balon Greyjoy,

49
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,557
Lord of the Iron Islands.

50
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,559
Do you hear me?

51
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,230
Theon...

52
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,200
promise me.

53
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:36,688
<i>( Door closes, latch clanks )

54
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,224
( wind howling )

55
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,765
Yes, Reek?

56
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:35,814
( Cooing )

57
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,183
Aemon: <i>Egg.

58
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,952
Egg.

59
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,390
Mother's looking for you.

60
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,960
Egg.

61
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,564
Get some sleep, Sam.

62
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,901
You'll have to speak
for him tomorrow.

63
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,603
You don't know that.

64
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,039
Get some sleep.

65
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,242
I'll watch over him.

66
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,313
Sam: <i>I'm staying, too.

67
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,415
<i>He's always been good to me.

68
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,118
I can't leave him now.

69
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,854
Egg!

70
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:19,524
( labored breathing )

71
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,568
Egg.

72
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,904
I dreamed...

73
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,674
that I was old.

74
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:49,187
Sam: <i>His name
was Aemon Targaryen.

75
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,390
<i>He came to us
from King's Landing.

76
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:56,394
<i>A maester of the Citadel,
chained and sworn,

77
00:09:56,396 --> 00:10:01,333
<i>and sworn brother of the
Night's Watch, ever faithful.

78
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,035
<i>No man was wiser

79
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,973
<i>or gentler or kinder.

80
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,743
At the Wall,
a dozen lord commanders

81
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,145
came and went during
his years of service,

82
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,248
but he was always there
to counsel them.

83
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,253
He was the blood
of the dragon...

84
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,758
but now his fire has gone out.

85
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,061
And now his watch is ended.

86
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,765
All: And now his watch is ended.

87
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,805
( Sniffles )

88
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,663
You're losing
all your friends, Tarly.

89
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,035
My beautiful wife.

90
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,642
When my father told me
we were marrying,

91
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,779
I half expected
a fat, bearded beast.

92
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,653
Do you know how pleased
I was when I saw you?

93
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:05,090
You've made me very happy.

94
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:12,363
Our scouts report that Stannis
Baratheon rides for Winterfell.

95
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,966
He's a respected commander.

96
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,802
His troops are loyal
and battle-tested.

97
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:22,240
He's hired thousands of foreign
sellswords to bolster his army.

98
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:26,478
But this storm is a stroke
of luck for us northerners.

99
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:31,316
Our people are used
to fighting in the frost.

100
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:36,321
His army is out there now
suffering in the snow.

101
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:39,023
One day I'll be
Lord of Winterfell

102
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,126
and Warden of the North.

103
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:44,195
You'll be my lady and Wardeness.

104
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,167
But isn't
your stepmother pregnant?

105
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,569
What of it?

106
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,405
What happens if she has a boy?

107
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,108
Then I'll have a baby brother.

108
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,543
But he'll be the heir.

109
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,112
I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

110
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,046
But you're a bastard.

111
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:06,017
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

112
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,755
I've been naturalized
by a royal decree from...

113
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:14,859
Tommen Baratheon?
Another bastard.

114
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,935
Bastards can rise
high in the world.

115
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:27,839
Like your half-brother Jon Snow.

116
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,842
Born the bastard of Winterfell,

117
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:34,813
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

118
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,283
You didn't know?

119
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,853
Yes, he's done
very well for himself.

120
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:42,821
Oh.

121
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:46,257
I nearly forgot why
I asked you to join me.

122
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,326
Come, my lady.

123
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,606
Ramsay: <i>Your northern friend.

124
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:07,145
Reek told me
you wanted to leave.

125
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,413
Why?

126
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,881
Winterfell is your home

127
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,617
and I am your husband.

128
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,185
<i>Tough old bird.

129
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,088
Everyone talks
when I start peeling them.

130
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,823
<i>But this one,

131
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:22,660
her heart gave out before
I even got to her face.

132
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,999
We do breed them tough
in the North.

133
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,907
Bring my wife
back to her chamber.

134
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,443
It's far too cold
out here for a lady.

135
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,579
You should hold on
to your candles.

136
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:45,450
<i>The nights are so long now.

137
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,801
( chuckles )

138
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,006
( chatter )

139
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,778
- ( chatter continues )
- ( man coughing )

140
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,001
Davos: <i>40 horses
died in the night.

141
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,737
We'll lose more come sunset.

142
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,739
We're running out of food.

143
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,842
We can't open the supply
line until the snow clears.

144
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,281
What else?

145
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,285
The Stormcrows
rode off last night.

146
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,223
500 men.

147
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,928
Sellswords.

148
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,065
Loyal to nothing but gold.

149
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,070
We still have a hard
march to Winterfell

150
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,639
and we won't be marching
anywhere in this weather.

151
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,974
And?

152
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,874
This isn't our time.

153
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:20,678
We should head back to Castle
Black when the snow clears.

154
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,014
I retreated from
King's Landing, Ser Davos.

155
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,784
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.

156
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,619
- Your Grace...
- Winter is coming.

157
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,990
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.

158
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:35,126
If we march
back to Castle Black,

159
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,228
we winter at Castle Black.

160
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,664
And who can say how many years

161
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,666
this winter will last?

162
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,067
It's better to wait for the right
time than risk everything.

163
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,636
This is the right time
and I will risk everything.

164
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,107
Because if I don't, we've lost.

165
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,242
We march to victory

166
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,879
or we march to defeat.

167
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:58,249
But we go forward. Only forward.

168
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,061
Your Grace.

169
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,501
I've trusted in your visions

170
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,704
and your prophecies for years.

171
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,206
You saw it yourself, my king,

172
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,142
when you stared into the flames.

173
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,410
<i>A great battle in the snow.

174
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,179
- I don't know what I saw.
- <i> You do know.

175
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,147
Trust yourself.

176
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,616
And you? Do you trust yourself?

177
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,452
I trust in the Lord.

178
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:39,290
Are you sure?

179
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:47,065
I have seen myself walk along
the battlements of Winterfell.

180
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:53,304
I have seen the flayed man
banners lowered to the ground.

181
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:05,750
But sometimes sacrifices must
be made to ensure victory.

182
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,421
I have shown you
the power of king's blood.

183
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,722
The usurper Robb Stark.

184
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,991
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

185
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,594
We don't have
Robert's bastard here.

186
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,932
No, we have someone better.

187
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,836
And your blood
runs through her veins.

188
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,939
Have you lost your mind?

189
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,774
Do you doubt me?

190
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,809
Still?

191
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,478
After all that you've seen.

192
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,213
There must be another way.

193
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,582
- Leeches or...
- There is only one way.

194
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,552
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

195
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,888
Only you can lead
the living against the dead.

196
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,191
All your life has led us
to this moment.

197
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,561
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

198
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,133
Get out.

201

A bit of mutton would be nice.

202
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:27,231
- A beauty from beyond the Wall.
- <i> ( man chuckles )

203
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,700
Where you going, love? Aren't we
better-looking than the fat man?

204
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:33,271
No, the question is is she pretty
down south in the real world

205
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,473
or is she pretty 'cause
she's the only girl here?

206
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,375
Even in White Harbor,
I'd want a kiss.

207
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,544
Come on, love, give us a kiss.

208
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:43,114
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, if you were my girl, I wouldn't leave you alone.

209
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,016
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

210

A man gets lonely
guarding the Wall.

211
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,357
There's no need to be rude.

212
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,760
We just want a little affection.

213
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,729
Ooh. ( laughs )

214
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,465
Get your hands off her.

have guard duty tonight.

00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:16,140
I said get your hands off her.

Brant: You're gonna
get yourself killed.

244
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,344
Your lover Jon Snow's
not here to save you.

245
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:23,281
I killed a white walker,
I killed a Thenn.

00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,713
I know they would have killed
you if Ghost hadn't come.

00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:32,083
No. No, no.
They were tiring out.

Don't be stupid, Sam.

260
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:41,058
You're not a fighter.

someone hurting you?

whatever happens, you'll
take care of Little Sam.

265
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,003
But of course I will.

00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,139

00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,376
I'll take care of you, too.

My lord, if I may.

310
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:12,162
I've heard Meereen
has become a free city.

311
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:15,366
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

312
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:19,169
Now, if you were to fight freed
men who'd be paid a wage...

There's your wages, funny man.

How long before the King of
Meereen comes to claim my pillow?

Don't be ridiculous.

320
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:45,396
My marriage to Hizdahr
is political.

321
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,932
I think he's smart enough
to understand that.

322
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,769
I think the Sons of the
Harpy have stopped killing

323
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:54,972
because their leader
was made king.

324
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,976
Are you jealous?

325
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:01,478
You think I'm petty enough
to speak ill of a man

326
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,948
just because he
represents competition?

327
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,684
I do.

328
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,318

329
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,853
You're right.

330
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,557
My motivations
are entirely impure.

331
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:24,168
Doesn't make me wrong.

332
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:31,875
You told me yourself I can't fight
enemies within and without.

333
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,311
So when enemies without
come knocking,

334
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,880
I need the city
of Meereen behind me.

335
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,416
I have no choice.

336
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,884
Everyone has a choice.

337
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,886
Even slaves have a choice...

338
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,254
Death or slavery.

339
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:48,025
So what else can I do, hmm?

340
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,829
Marry me instead.

341
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:57,401
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

342
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,069
I couldn't.

343
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,337
Why not?

344
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,307
You are queen.
You can do what you like.

345
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,745
No, I can't.

346
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:12,049
Then you are the only person
in Meereen who's not free.

347
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,697
And I know I'm here to serve
my queen and not give advice,

348
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:30,033
but can I make
one more suggestion?

349
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,906
Of course.

350
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,977
On the day of the great games,

351
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:43,147
gather all the Great
Masters and Wise Masters

352
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:46,416
and Worthy Masters you can find

353
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:49,052
and slaughter them all.

354
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,160
I am a queen, not a butcher.

355
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:04,101
All rulers are either
butchers or meat.

356
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,912
You there. Where would
I find the High Septon

357
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:18,448
or High Sparrow or whatever
bloody fool name he's got?

358
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,520
It's not as good a name as
Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.

359
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,923
You should have the decency

360
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:28,192
to stand when
you speak to a lady.

361
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:31,328
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

362
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,297
Don't spar with me,

- You?
- Hips.

00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,106
Ah.

367
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:46,844
A man of the people.
Is that your game?

368
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:51,048
It's an old game.
Dull and unconvincing.

369
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,850
A man of the people

370
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:56,453
who does Cersei's
dirty work for her.

371
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,088
The people always
do the dirty work.

372
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,226
Spare me the homilies. I can
smell a fraud from a mile away.

373

Useful talent.

I'm here for my grandson

Your grandson and granddaughter

What, then?

388
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,564
I imagine this
is strange for you.

389
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,933
Everyone you meet
has a hidden motive

390
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:46,303
and you pride yourself
on sniffing it out.

391
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:49,206
<i>But I'm telling you
a simple truth.

392

I serve the gods.

The gods demand justice.

396
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:00,384
By the holy text,
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

<i>I'll give you my own.

399
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:06,223
I've read

<i>Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.

00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:18,335

You live among murderers,

and yet you punish Loras

408
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,884
and Margaery for defending
her brother?

409
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:38,822
Yes. The gods' laws must
be applied to all equally.

410
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:41,258
If it's equality
you want, so be it.

411
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,896
When House Tyrell stops sending
our crops to the capital,

412
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:47,431
everyone here will starve.

413
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:51,435

Have you ever reaped the grain?

Has anyone in House Tyrell?

418
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,150
A lifetime of wealth and power

419
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,953

420
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:15,959
You are the few,

00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:23,753
You don't even want to
know what's going on in...

534
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,892
( breathing heavily )

535
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:36,065
Your nose is bleeding.

536
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,738
It's nothing. It's the dry air.

537
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:48,478
My dagger was coated with a
special ointment from Asshai.

538
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,514
<i>They call it the Long Farewell.

539
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,082
It takes time to work,

540
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:57,954
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

541
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,489
death.

542
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:10,099
The only antidote.

543
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:17,373
Who's the most beautiful
woman in the world?

544
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,109
( Quietly ) You.

545
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,913
Sorry? Who?

546
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,017
You.

547
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,320
Don't drop it.

548
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:43,466
( Gasping )

549
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:47,036
I think you're
very handsome as well.

550
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:34,651
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

551
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,321
It felt like the safest place.

552
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:41,324
Not for your clientele, clearly.

553
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:44,761
It was an establishment
like no other.

554
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,297
The sheer range
of appetites catered to.

555
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,232
Desires that didn't even exist

556
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,334
until we invented them.

557
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:56,039
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

558
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:59,075
The past is the past.

559
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:03,613
The future is all
that's worth discussing.

560
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:05,748
The future of House Tyrell.

561
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,085
Don't pretend to have
any concern for my house,

562
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,219
my grandchildren or me.

563
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:13,156
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

564
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:15,191
as soon as things
started to go wrong.

565
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:18,027
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

566
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,196
that our fates are joined.

567
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,798
Together we murdered a king.

568
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,336
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

569
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:29,973
And if I should meet
with some accident

570
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:33,142
here at your broken
little flesh market,

571
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:37,146
they'll never even find
what's left of you.

572
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:39,315
So...

573
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,284
do you deny a part in all this?

574
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:44,887
Cersei summoned me
to King's Landing.

575
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,356
I dared not refuse her.

576
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:47,757
And what did she want?

577
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:51,127
<i>A piece of information
she knew that I had.

578
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,797
Neither silence
nor lies were an option.

579
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,500
But I have other information

580
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:59,902
of which she is unaware.

581
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:04,273
And as you say,
our interests are aligned.

582
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:07,543
I have a gift for you.

583
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,045
What kind of gift?

584
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:12,448
The same kind I gave Cersei.

585
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,084
A handsome young man.

586
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:30,466
Yezzan: <i>Many worthy
fighters have died

When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

589
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:39,475
it will represent a significant
rise in your station.

590
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:42,011

00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:50,953
So whatever happens, the gods

00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:56,526
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

595
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,330
You and you. You.

596
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,634

Sitting through the great
games will be bad enough.

602
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:33,362
For generations in the days
leading up to the great games,

603
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:34,897
it has been customary
for our ruler

604
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,466
to make the rounds
of the lower pits

605
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:40,203
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

606

I had it myself for supper
only last night.

guilty of any acts

were to confess
before the trial...

699
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:26,835

the Mother's mercy entail?

712
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:10,279
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

713
00:54:10,281 --> 00:54:11,914
No one does.

714
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:16,619
There's no name on it or
anywhere else in the chapel.

715
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,989
No, the people
who built this place

716
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:23,926
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them

717
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:28,697
the way Baelor did with that great
gilded monstrosity up there.

718
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,232
Hmm.

719
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,935
Their faith was clean.

720
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:36,071
Strip away the gold
and the ornaments,

721
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:40,142
knock down the statues
and the pillars,

722
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:42,878
and this is what remains.

723
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:48,484
Something simple...

724
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:55,157
and solid and true.

725
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:02,731
The Tyrells' finery
will be stripped away.

726
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:04,700
<i>Their lies knocked down.

727
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:08,904
<i>Their true hearts
laid bare for all to see.

728
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,574
And so it will be for all of us.

729
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:15,678
High and low alike.

730
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,150
What will we find

731
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:24,920
when we strip away your finery?

732
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:31,060
<i>A young man came to us
not long ago.

733
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:34,630
Broken in body and spirit.

734
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:39,168
He had so much to strip away.

735
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:43,572
<i>So much weighing him down.

736
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:47,843
<i>But piece by piece,
he unburdened himself.

737
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:50,946
<i>Let go of vanity,

738
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,882
pride, sin.

739
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,686
Now his soul is so light,

740
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:01,957
he will float through the
Seven Heavens like a bird.

741
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,959
Hmm.

742
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:11,100
And he has much
to say about you.

743
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,593
Move.

744
00:56:38,763 --> 00:56:41,363
Let me go immediately.

745
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:44,433
You will order her to let me go.

746
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:47,336
I am the queen! I am the queen!

747
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:49,304
Have you lost your mind?

748
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:51,206
Let me go!

749
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:54,309
<i>Get your filthy hands off me!

750
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:56,478
<i>Have you lost your mind?

751
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,149
<i>I am the queen! Let me go!

752
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,390
Look at me.

753
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:12,394
Look at my face.

754
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:18,400
It's the last thing
you'll see before you die.
