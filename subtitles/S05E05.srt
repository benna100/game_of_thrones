1
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,626
I'm so sorry, my queen.

2
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,194
He was a good man.

3
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:45,564
"Barristan the Bold"
they called him.

4
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,834
He crossed a continent
to serve me.

5
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,937
He was a loyal friend.

6
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,940
And he died in an alley,

7
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:59,578
butchered by cowards
who hide behind masks.

8
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:03,348
We could pull back
to the pyramid district,

9
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,252
<i>secure it, and use it as a
base from which to operate.

10
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,922
Then we clean the city out,

11
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:13,659
<i>neighborhood by neighborhood,
street by street,

12
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,229
until the rats
have nowhere left to hide.

13
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,700
I prefer
your earlier suggestion.

14
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:27,472
Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's
great families and bring them to me.

15
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,711
But I'm the leader of my family.

16
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,948
No, Your Grace.

17
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,984
I had nothing to do with this.

18
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,386
Your Grace!

19
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,385
( speaking Valyrian )

20
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,603
( speaking Valyrian )

21
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,373
Don't want to overfeed them.

22
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,078
Tomorrow perhaps.

23
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,388
( men whimpering )

24
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,469
( roaring )

25
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:58,083
"And though Daenerys maintains
her grip on Slaver's Bay,"

26
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:02,020
forces rise against her
from within and without.

27
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,523
She refuses to leave
until the freedom

28
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,926
"of the former slaves is secure."

29
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,629
She sounds like quite a woman.

30
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,631
And she's alone,

31
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,565
under siege,

32
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:17,068
no family to guide her
or protect her.

33
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:21,807
Her last relation
thousands of miles away,

34
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:26,511
useless, dying.

35
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,147
Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

36
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:34,586
A Targaryen alone in the world

37
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,689
is a terrible thing.

38
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,827
Maester Aemon.

39
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,628
Lord Commander.

40
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,866
Sam, I'd like to speak
to the maester alone.

41
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,882
How are you feeling?

42
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,718
Oh, like a hundred-year-old man

43
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,955
slowly freezing to death.

44
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,061
I need your advice.

45
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:19,130
There's something I want
to do, something I...

46
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,232
have to do.

47
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,068
But it'll divide
the Night's Watch.

48
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,902
Bitterly.

49
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:27,239
Half the men will hate me the
moment I give the order.

50
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:31,977
Half the men hate you
already, Lord Commander.

51
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,645
Do it.

52
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,213
But you don't know what it is.

53
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,749
That doesn't matter.

54
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,285
You do.

55
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:45,957
You will find little joy
in your command.

56
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,292
But with luck,

57
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:53,732
you will find the strength
to do what needs to be done.

58
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:57,602
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

59
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:01,540
Winter is almost upon us.

60
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,808
Kill the boy

61
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,646
and let the man be born.

62
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,557
Where are the rest
of the free folk now?

63
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,926
Where have they gone?

64
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,898
Who leads them?

65
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,934
They followed Mance.

66
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:32,304
They won't follow anyone else.

67
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,975
What about you?

68
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:41,112
Hard to lead
when you're in chains.

69
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,850
What if I unchained you?

70
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,653
Why would you do that?

71
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,856
Because you are not my enemy.

72
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:52,657
And I'm not yours.

73
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,694
You sure seemed like my enemy
when you were killing my friends.

74
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,296
For 8,000 years the Night's
Watch have sworn an oath

75
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:02,267
to be the shield that
guards the realms of men.

76
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,204
And for 8,000 years we've
fallen short of that oath.

77
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,908
You belong to the realms of men.

78
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,176
All of you.

79
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,613
And now everything
is going to change?

80
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,714
- It is.
- Why now?

81
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:20,352
Because now I am Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

82
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,788
What would you have me do,

83
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,691
Lord Commander?

84
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,893
I'd have you go
north of the Wall.

85
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:33,098
Gather the remaining free folk wherever
they are and bring them back here.

86
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,401
I'll open the gates for
them and let them through.

87
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:39,804
I'll find them lands to
settle south of the Wall.

88
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,875
They won't kneel for you
and neither will I.

89
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,244
I don't want them
to kneel for me.

90
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,980
I want them to fight with
me when the time comes.

91
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,716
The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows

92
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:55,020
is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly

93
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,087
and make me eat them.

94
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,423
And how many of your
people can't fight?

95
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:02,293
The women, the children,
the old, the sick...

96
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,229
What happens to them?

97
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,797
You're condemning them to death.

98
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:10,869
Worse than death because you're
too proud to make peace.

99
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:16,307
Or maybe you're not proud.

100
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,911
Maybe you're just a coward.

101
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:29,954
Easy thing to say
to a man in chains.

102
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,746
Your people need a leader.

103
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:58,349
And they need to get south of
the Wall before it's too late.

104
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,151
We don't have much time
and they have less.

105
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:04,889
The walkers are coming and
they'll hit your people first.

106
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,326
I'm not asking you to make
peace to save your skin.

107
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:12,964
Make peace to save your people.

108
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:23,108
Most of them are at Hardhome.

109
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,342
You know where that is?

110
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,376
Up on Storrold's Point.

111
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,346
I can give you 10 horses
and nine other men.

112
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,482
You can get there in a week.

113
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,517
We'll need ships.

114
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,755
I'll talk to King Stannis
about lending you his fleet.

115
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,493
All right, then.

116
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,430
You're coming with me.

117
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,800
<i>You're the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

118
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,502
They need to hear it from you.

119
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:53,071
They need to know
the ships they are boarding

120
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,507
won't be torched
in the middle of the sea.

121
00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:01,813
You come with me or I don't go.

122
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,884
<i>( Men shouting )

123
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,353
( shouting continues )

124
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,822
You'd bring wildlings here
through our gates?

125
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:14,926
Men, women, and children will die
by the thousands if we do nothing.

126
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:18,129
Let them die. We got our
own to worry about.

127
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,966
- Less enemies for us.
- ( cheering )

128
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,268
Fewer.

129
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,470
- What?
- Nothing.

130
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,274
Look, well, there is
good farmland in the Gift.

131
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,110
- ( Men laughing )
- Land that no one uses now.

132
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,178
A dozen abandoned villages.

133
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,014
And why do you think the farmers
abandoned those villages?

134
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,350
<i>Because the wildlings
raided them for years.

135
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:43,521
Cut them down just like
they did this boy's people.

136
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,356
Men: Aye!

137
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:49,561
Alliser: <i>We've been fighting
them for thousands of years.

138
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,496
They've slaughtered villages.

139
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,132
<i>They've slaughtered
our brothers.

140
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,534
And we've slaughtered theirs.

141
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:02,874
I will follow you
anywhere, you know that.

142
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,243
- But they killed Grenn.
- Men: Yes.

143
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,946
- And they killed Pyp.
- Men: Aye.

144
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,949
<i>They killed 50 of our brothers.

145
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,017
<i>I can't forget that.

146
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,152
I can't forgive it.

147
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,521
You were at the Fist
of the First Men.

148
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,457
If we abandon them,
you know what they become.

149
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,593
<i>We can learn to live
with the wildlings

150
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,195
<i>or we can add them
to the army of the dead.

151
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:29,267
Whatever they are now,
they're better than that.

152

<i>If you have something

It's all right.

159
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,084
You don't mean it, do you?

160
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,521
Telling the wildlings
you want to make peace.

161
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,190
You're just doing it
to trick them.

162
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,458
It's not a trick.

163
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,660
They burned my village.

164
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:31,262
They put an arrow
through my father's head

165
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,330
right in front of me.

166
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:36,567
They butchered my mother,
everyone I ever knew.

167
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,711
I know what it's like
to lose the people you love.

168
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,649
I know this is hard for you.

169
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,286
But winter is coming.

170
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:59,090
We know what's coming with it.

171
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,592
We can't face it alone.

172
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:10,368
Will there be anything else
you need, Lord Commander?

173
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,973
No.

She's far away
from the Lannisters.

180
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,311
<i>This is her home.

181
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,282
Maybe Lady Sansa's
better off here.

182
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,052
Better off with the Boltons

183
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:04,655
who murdered
her mother and brother?

184
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:15,700
Sansa's in danger even
if she doesn't realize it.

185
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,169
<i>( Door opens )

186
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,783
Thank you.

187
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,486
You've lived here a long time?

188
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,656
Aye.

189
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,793
Did you know Lord Eddard?

190
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,463
I knew him

191
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,599
and his father before him.

192
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,437
The Starks are gone now.

193
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,771
Not all of them.

194
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:57,108
<i>I know who's inside that castle.

195
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,177
Everyone knows.

196
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,211
The Boltons.

197
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,314
I'm not talking
about the Boltons.

198
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,617
I need to get a message to her.

199
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,753
To Sansa Stark.

200
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,689
Who are you?

201
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,859
Someone who swore
to keep her safe.

202
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,794
Swore to who?

203
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,763
Her mother.

204
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,531
Her mother's dead.

205
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,202
That doesn't release me
from an oath.

206
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,407
I served Lady Catelyn.

207
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,343
I serve her still.

208
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,847
Who do you serve?

209
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,355
Ramsay: <i>Come back here.

210
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:48,659
Myranda.

211
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,661
I saw you staring at her.

212
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,896
I'm going to marry her.

213
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:56,400
That will involve looking
at her from time to time.

214
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,572
You said you'd marry me.

215
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,574
And I meant it.

216
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,244
When I was a bastard named Snow.

217
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,812
<i>But I'm a Bolton now.

218
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:12,550
What I want is no longer
the primary consideration.

219
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:15,553
I'm furthering a dynasty.

220
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,290
Do you think she's pretty?

221
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,193
( Scoffs ) Of course I do.

222
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,928
I'm not blind.

223
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,500
( Sighs )

224
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,677
You think she's pretty, too.

225
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,681
I'm looking forward
to our wedding night.

226
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,852
But don't worry, I'll have
plenty of time for you.

227
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,855
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

228
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,824
( laughs )

229
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,962
You're the kennel
master's daughter.

230
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:02,433
Who are you going to marry,
the stable keeper's son?

231
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,741
You're mine.

232
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,376
You're not going anywhere.

233
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,545
Unless I have to listen
to more of your jealousy.

234
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:19,617
Jealousy bores me. You remember
what happens to people who bore me.

235
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:26,357
You're not going to bore
me, are you, Myranda?

236
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,810
Never.

237
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:07,331
<i>( Knocking on door )

238
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,638
Beg pardon, my lady.

239
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,374
I've come to refill
the wash basin.

240
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,709
Oh, I don't need...

241
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,779
You still have
friends in the North.

242
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:22,980
If you're ever in trouble,

243
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:28,019
light a candle in the highest
window of the broken tower.

244
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:31,689
- But who...
- You're not alone.

245
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,562
I like your dress.

246
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,532
Who made it for you?

247
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,468
I made it myself.

248
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,603
Really?

249
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,506
Who... who are you?

250
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:27,545
I'm Myranda, the kennel
master's daughter.

251
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,982
May I?

252
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,889
Oh, wonderful.

253
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,392
The stitching.

254
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,695
- Who taught you?
- My mother.

255
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:49,567
I'm sorry for what
happened to her.

256
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,068
Thank you.

257
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,772
It's good that she taught you.

258
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:55,774
It was a gift.

259
00:22:55,775 --> 00:23:01,045
Now every time you wear
something you made,

260
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,913
you can remember her.

261
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,582
I'd rather have a mother.

262
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:08,119
I know. It's not the same.

263
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:11,822
Still, it's good to remember.

264
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:14,792
Remember the way things were.

265
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,562
I almost forgot.

266
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,499
There's something else

267
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:24,535
<i>to help you remember.

268
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,977
<i>( dogs barking )

269
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:36,147
Down there at the end.

270
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,182
What is it?

271
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:40,451
That would spoil the surprise.

272
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,619
<i>( Dogs growling )

273
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:44,588
Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.

274
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,024
You won't believe it
when you see it.

275
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,727
<i>( Growling continues )

276
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:52,062
<i>( dogs barking )

<i>- ( barking continues )

Theon?

279
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:03,934
You shouldn't be here.

280
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:21,919
<i>( Wind whistling )

281
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:28,225
You smell particularly
ripe this evening.

282
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,630
Pour me some wine.

283
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:58,956
Do you have
something to tell me?

284
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,759
No, my lord.

285
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:03,727
Reek.

286
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,266
She saw me.

287
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,301
Who?

288
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,170
Sansa. Lady Sansa.

289
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,706
She came to the kennels.

290
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:17,708
She saw you?

291
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,910
Yes. I'm sorry, master.

292
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,246
Forgive me. I didn't think...

293
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,348
Come here.

294
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:35,125
You mustn't keep
secrets from me, Reek.

295
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,294
Get on your knees.

296
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,909
Give me your hand.

297
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,899
I forgive you.

298
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:29,747
I trust you find your
chamber suitable, my lady.

299
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:32,082
Yes, thank you, my lord.

300
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,118
Allow me.

301
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,256
Mother.

302
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,692
Thank you, Ramsay.

303
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:55,339
My lady, we are all a
family, we northerners.

304
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:59,109
Our blood ties go back
thousands of years.

305
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,079
So I'd like to drink
to our wedding.

306
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:05,916
May our happiness
spread from Moat Cailin

307
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,217
to the Last Hearth.

308
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,153
To your wedding.

309
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:11,355
To your wedding.

310
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:20,397
It must be difficult for you
being in a strange place.

311
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,233
This isn't a strange place.
This is my home.

312
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,370
It's the people who are strange.

313
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,209
You're right.

314
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,144
Very strange.

315
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:39,016
More wine, please.

316
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:47,858
Ramsay: <i>I heard you two
had been reunited.

317
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,428
A fitting place for it.

318
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:56,033
I like to imagine that
the last time you spoke

319
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,469
was in this very room.

320
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,741
<i>Are you still angry with him

321
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,943
<i>after he...

322
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,448
what he did?

323
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,817
Don't worry.

324
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,286
The North remembers.

325
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,223
I punished him for it.

326
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,492
He's not ironborn anymore.

327
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:25,028
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

328
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,231
He's a new man.

329
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,301
A new person, anyway.

330
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,170
Aren't you, Reek?

331
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:34,471
Yes, master.

332
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,940
That's his new name... Reek.

333
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,810
Why are you doing this?

334
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:44,248
Because Reek has
something to say to you.

335
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,250
Don't you, Reek?

336
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,262
An apology.

337
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:07,337
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

338
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:11,842
Apologize for murdering
her two brothers.

339
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,016
I'm sorry.

340
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,553
Look at her, Reek.

341
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,188
<i>An apology doesn't mean anything

342
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,025
<i>if you're not looking
the person in the eye.

343
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:37,301
- I'm sorry.
- Ramsay:<i> Sorry about what?

344
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,137
For killing your brothers.

345
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,616
There, over and done with.

346
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:56,420
<i>Doesn't everyone
feel better? I do.

347
00:30:56,422 --> 00:31:00,624
That was getting very tense.

348
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:02,526
Whew.

349
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,564
You know what, my lady?

350
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,901
What with him having
murdered your brothers

351
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:14,104
and the rest
of your family gone...

352
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:19,877
Reek here is the nearest
thing to living kin

353
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,312
that you have left.

354
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:25,115
Reek.

355
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,484
You will give away the bride.

356
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:33,490
Someone has to.
What better person?

357
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,058
Good? Good?

358
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,528
Yes, yes, very good.

359
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,631
Wonderful.

360
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:44,601
Walda and I have
some good news as well,

361
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,304
since we're all together.

362
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,912
We're going to have a baby.

363
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,251
I'm very happy for you.

364
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,120
From the way she's carrying,

365
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:07,057
Maester Wolkan says
it looks like a boy.

366
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,941
Ramsay: <i>How can you be sure?

367
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,709
Sure of what?

368
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,045
That she's pregnant.

369
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,980
I mean...

370
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,114
how can you tell?

371
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:35,052
Maester Wolkan has assured
us beyond all doubt.

372
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,563
So how did you manage it?

373
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,298
Manage what?

374
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,267
Getting her pregnant.

375
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,602
I imagine you're familiar
with the procedure.

376
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:56,206
Of course, but how did you...

377
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,374
find it?

378
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,343
You disgraced yourself at dinner

379
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:02,079
parading that creature
before the Stark girl.

380
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:05,415
- And if it's a boy?
- ( chuckles )

381
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,552
You're worried about
your position.

382
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:11,254
My position is quite clear.

383
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,423
I'm your son

384
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:17,027
until a better
alternative comes along.

385
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,472
You've never asked me
about your mother.

386
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,544
Why would I?

387
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:38,348
She had me, she died.

388
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,385
And here we are.

389
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,754
She was a peasant girl.

390
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:46,223
Pretty in a common sort of way.

391
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:48,158
She was the miller's wife.

392
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,529
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent.

393
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,397
So I had him hanged

394
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:57,267
and I took her beneath the
tree where he was swaying.

395
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,269
She fought me the whole time.

396
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,505
She was lucky
I didn't hang her, too.

397
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:03,740
<i>A year later
she came to my gates

398
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:06,276
<i>with a squalling baby
in her arms.

399
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,712
<i>A baby she claimed was mine.

400
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,614
I nearly had her whipped

401
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:13,417
and the child
thrown in the river.

402
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,623
But then I looked at you

403
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:23,060
<i>and I saw then what I see now.

404
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,529
You are my son.

405
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:40,544
Stannis Baratheon has
an army at Castle Black.

406
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:43,146
But he won't stay for long.

407
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,315
He wants the Iron Throne,

408
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:50,220
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

409
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,256
He means to take the North.

410
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,594
But the North is ours.

411
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,363
It's yours and mine.

412
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,767
Will you help me defeat him?

413
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,870
Yes.

414
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:17,881
Is this every book there is?

415
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,783
Every book there is?

416
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:23,453
- In the world.
- Well, no.

417
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:27,491
There are thousands and
thousands of books out there.

418
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,392
This library is rather
small, actually.

419
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,495
Where you grew up,
were there more books?

420
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:35,398
My father's not
the most literate man.

421
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:40,604
They say the Citadel has the
largest library in the world.

422
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:43,406
Where's that?

423
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:46,343
The Citadel?

424
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,512
In Oldtown.

425
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,852
I'm sorry I don't know things.

426
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,455
Oh, Gilly, look at me.

427
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:02,526
<i>You know how to do a hundred
things I can never do.

428
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:04,694
You can build a fire
with wet wood.

429
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:07,497
You can cook.
You can stitch a wound.

430
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,699
I can wash the linens.
I can sweep the floor.

431
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:13,537
- Well...
- Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?

432
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,907
<i>It's where they train
the maesters.

433
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,408
Like Maester Aemon?

434
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,945
I wanted to be one
when I was young.

435
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:29,252
Instead, I became a man
of the Night's Watch.

436
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,391
Far more adventure
up here anyway.

437
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:37,594
I wouldn't have met you.

438
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,829
<i>( Footsteps )

439
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,702
Ah, Your Grace.

440
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:54,878
You're Samwell Tarly?

441
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,814
I am, Your Grace.

442
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,817
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

443
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,756
He defeated my brother
at the Battle of Ashford.

444
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,326
<i>Only battle Robert ever lost.

445
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:14,397
I told him he shouldn't go so far
west so soon, but he never listened.

446
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:18,868
<i>Fine soldier, your father.

447
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,638
You don't look like a soldier.

448
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,308
But I'm told you killed
a white walker.

449
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,310
I did, Your Grace.

450
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:27,877
<i>How?

451
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,714
With a dagger
made of dragonglass.

452
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:31,514
Dragonglass?

453
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:32,716
What the maesters call obsidian.

454
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,418
I know what it is.
We have it in Dragonstone.

455
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,921
Why would obsidian
kill a walker?

456
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:38,822
I don't know.

457
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:40,890
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

458
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,626
hoping to find something,
and all I've learned

459
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:45,962
is that the children of the forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

460
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:51,368
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

461
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,672
I've seen it, Your Grace.

462
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,040
Seen what?

463
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,276
The army of the dead.

464
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:04,581
- And when they come...
- We have to know how to fight them.

465
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:10,287
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

466
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,739
It's time.

467
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,574
Uh, Your Grace.

468
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:32,809
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

469
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:36,846
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

470
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,982
If Jon Snow returns
with the wildlings.

471
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,016
We can't wait that long.

472
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:43,486
We have the advantage... more men,
more horses, all fed and rested.

473
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:47,324
<i>But every day we wait, the
odds shift in Bolton's favor.

474
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,992
This could turn to winter
at any moment.

475
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,428
We have to act now.
Give the order.

476
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,629
We march at sunrise.

477
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,464
I'll choose a dozen men to stay

478
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:57,000
and guard the queen
and the princess.

479
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,903
No need. They're coming with us.

480
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,605
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

481
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,941
- Won't they be safer...
- Here?

482
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:10,380
Half these watchmen
are killers and rapists.

483
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:12,882
No, they march with us.

484
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,587
As you wish, Your Grace.

485
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,789
( Wind howling )

486
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:30,800
<i>- ( chatter )
- ( horses snorting )

Davos: Beg your pardon?

489
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:48,752
At Winterfell.

490
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,854
All the Kings in the North
are buried there.

491
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,655
Bran the Builder
and King Dorren and...

492
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,991
First things first.
It's a long march ahead.

493
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,527
And then we have
to take the castle.

494
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:58,762
Is there going to be a battle?

495
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:00,997
Aye, princess, but you
won't be anywhere near...

496
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,534
That's enough talk
of battle, Ser Davos.

497
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,169
You'll scare the child.

498
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:09,139
Davos: <i>Yes, my queen.

499
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,610

- Well, I am.

00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:17,447
When the battle comes,
promise you'll protect me.

501
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,682
I promise.

502
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:42,539
I hope you know what you're
doing with these wildlings.

503
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,541
I need those ships.

504
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:49,612
You'll get them back,
I swear it.

505
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,516
Have a safe journey, Your Grace.

506
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:56,186

No.

512
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:22,171
You're still too weak.

Ser Barristan?

<i>Are you ashamed?

00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,282
<i>You were ambushed, outnumbered.

Wounded in war,

520
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,995
there is no shame for this.

521
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,797
I am ashamed

522
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:23,733
because when the knife go in

523
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:27,103
and I fall to the ground,

524
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,639
I am afraid.

525
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:32,742
All men fear death.

526
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:35,979
No, not death.

527
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:40,016
I fear

528

I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

529
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,360
Now you have given the
Masters what they deserve.

530

If I give everyone
what they deserve,

531
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:28,364
I'll have no one left to rule.

532
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,233
Ser Barristan counseled mercy

533

up to the morning he died.

534

Your Grace, I think
that I am not fit

538

You are as fit as anyone I know.

540
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:53,389
You know why I'm here.

541
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:57,460
And you know who will suffer the
most if this all falls apart.

542
00:44:57,462 --> 00:45:01,064
<i>So what do you think?

543
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,102
I can only tell you
what I have seen, Your Grace.

544
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:10,306
I have seen you listen
to your counselors.

545
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:14,811
I have seen you lean on their
experience when your own was lacking

546
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:19,315
and weigh the choices
they put before you.

547
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:23,820
And I have seen you
ignore your counselors...

548
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,957
because there was
a better choice.

549
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:31,194
One that only you could see.

550
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:50,446
My... my queen,
please do not do this.

551
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,281
<i>What about "valar morghulis"?

552
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,985
I did not want to die a coward.

553
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,892
Apparently I do not
want to die at all.

554
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:04,293
( Sniffles )

555
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:08,197
It takes courage to admit fear.

556
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,501
And to admit a mistake.

557
00:46:11,503 --> 00:46:15,404
I came here to tell you
that I was wrong.

558
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:21,210
I was wrong and you were right.

559
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:24,814
About tradition.

560
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:29,318
About bringing the people
of this city together.

561
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,323
I will reopen the fighting pits.

562
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:36,259
To free men only.

563
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:41,297
Slavery will never return to
Meereen, not while I live.

564
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,566
Yes, my queen.

565
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:50,139
And in order to forge a lasting
bond with the Meereenese people,

566
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,976
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family.

567
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,215
Thankfully a suitor
is already on his knees.

568
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,311
Don't worry.

569
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:32,615
I'll be fine. Nothing
broken, I don't think.

570
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,352
Where are we now?

571
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,955
Not the Rhoyne.

572
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:46,529
Long, sullen silences

573
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:51,033
and an occasional
punch in the face.

574
00:47:51,903 --> 00:47:55,171
The Mormont way.

575
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,610
Let's start over.

576
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,446
I apologize for before.

577
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:06,482
<i>My mouth sometimes
runs away from me.

578
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:10,353
This doesn't have to be
an unpleasant trip.

579
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:17,994
We're going to be spending a lot of
time together on the way to Meereen.

580
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:19,629
We are.

581
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:24,200
What would make our time
together truly enjoyable

582
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:26,168
would be some wine.

583
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,671
No wine.

584
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:35,144
I am a person who drinks.

585
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:38,114
People who drink
need to keep drinking.

586
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:41,117
<i>Otherwise, they're not...

587
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:49,358
I know where we are.

588
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,261
You're taking us
through Valyria.

589
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,296
I am.

590
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:55,965
Have you sailed
this route before?

591
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:56,699
No.

592
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,467
You're going to bring
Daenerys a souvenir

593
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:01,437
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

594
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,607
I think you'll be plenty.

595
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:07,310
<i>You know what they say.

596
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:10,212
The Doom still rules Valyria.

597
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:14,183
What about the demons
and the flames?

598
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,485
<i>Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

599
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:18,487
Jorah: <i>No.

600
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:21,991
But pirates are.

601
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:24,327
Oh.

602
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:29,265
Tyrion: The Smoking Sea.

603
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,233
How many centuries
before we learn

604
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:34,403
how to build cities
like this again?

605
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,073
For thousands of years
the Valyrians were

606
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:41,577
the best in the world
at almost everything.

607
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,579
And then...

608
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:46,349
And then they weren't.

609
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:48,617
And then they weren't.

610
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:55,358
"They held each other close and
turned their backs upon the end."

611
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,094
<i>The hills that split asunder

612
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:01,063
and the black
that ate the skies;

613
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:03,432
The flames that shot
so high and hot

614
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,201
that even dragons burned;

615
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:07,236
Would never be the final sights

616
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:10,339
that fell upon their eyes.

617
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,341
A fly upon a wall,

618
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,512
"the waves the sea wind
whipped and churned..."

619
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,582
"The city of a thousand years,"

620
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,550
and all that men had learned;

621
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:25,221
The Doom consumed it all alike,

622
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:28,491
"and neither of them turned."

623
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:33,562
I would clap.

624
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:41,103
I suppose this is it, then.

625
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:44,473
This is what remains.

626
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,679
<i>( Water splashes )

627
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:26,816
What was that?

628
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:33,689
- ( Rasping )
- Stone Men!

629
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:36,158
Don't let them touch you!

630
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,310
Get behind!

631
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:58,881
Mormont, cut me free!

632
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,616
Mormont!

633
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,600
Mormont!

634
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:20,202
- Mormont!
- ( shouts )

635
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,573
( faintly ) Tyrion?

636
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:02,945
Tyrion.

637
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:04,914
Tyrion.

638
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:08,250
Tyrion.

639
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:11,520
You're all right.

640
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:23,399
You're heavier than you look.

641
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,404
Did any of them touch you?

642
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:32,841
You?

643
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:40,349
I've seen greyscale before,

644
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:41,550
but nothing like that.

645
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:45,554
I suppose that's why
they send them there.

646
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:50,759
It'd be kinder to put daggers in
their hearts and be done with it.

647
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:57,933
Thank you for saving me.

648
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:02,404
Of course, I wouldn't
have needed saving

649
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,608
if you hadn't kidnapped me
in the first place.

650
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,547
So what now?

651
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:13,349
We walk up the coast.

652
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,784
With luck, we'll find
a fishing village.

653
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,920
Maybe another boat.

654
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,588
Without luck?

655
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,259
We've got a long walk
ahead of us.

656
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,496
I'll get some wood for a fire.

657
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,032
Try to get some rest, huh?

658
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:33,869
That's the best idea
you've had all day.
