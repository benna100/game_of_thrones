1
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,992
Is that Estermont?

2
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,695
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

3
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,966
The Sapphire Isle.

4
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,305
Why are we on a merchant ship?

5
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,540
Why no Lannister sails?

6
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,377
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

7
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,713
We'll get off earlier
not far from Sunspear,

8
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,717
row ourselves to the Dornish
shore in the night.

9
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,186
You ever been to Dorne?

10
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,921
- No.
- I have.

11
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:43,923
The Dornish are crazy.

12
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,559
All they want to do is fight
and fuck, fuck and fight.

13
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,295
You should be happy to go back.

14
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,464
There's nothing
like a good fight

15
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,533
to get you in the mood
for fucking.

16
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,735
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

17
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,404
to clear your head
for the next fight.

18
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,006
It's how the two work together.

19
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,909
Now we're gonna be doing
a lot of fighting, I'm sure.

20
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,911
Well, I am.

21
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,879
But I don't imagine we'll get
to stick around for the rest.

22
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,881
Not after we've kidnapped
their princess.

23
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,516
We're not kidnapping
their princess.

24
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:15,520
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

25
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,289
Your niece?

26
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,898
I've been doing this sort
of thing a long time.

27
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,101
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

28
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,902
I know. Why are you here?

29
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,472
Why not send 40 of me?
Or an army?

30
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,108
Unlike most folks,
you've actually got one.

31
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,677
Because I don't want
to start a war.

32
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:42,981
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

33
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,420
It has to be me.

34
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,591
If I'm putting something
like this together,

35
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,092
a one-handed man
who happens to be

36
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,663
one of the most recognizable
faces in Westeros is not...

37
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,798
It has to be me.

38
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,872
You set your brother
free, didn't you?

39
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,376
I'll bet your sister
didn't like that.

40
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:15,380
Varys set him free.

41
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:23,822
Well, if you ever see
the wee fucker,

42
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,857
give him my regards.

43
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,064
He murdered my father.

44
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:37,969
If I ever see him,
I'll split him in two.

45
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,340
And then I'll give
him your regards.

46
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,916
The Iron Bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

47
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,052
Given the expense of
rebuilding the royal fleet...

48
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,787
How much can the crown afford?

49
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,089
<i>With winter coming,

50
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,058
half what they ask, less?

51
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,628
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

52
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,697
House Tyrell could
front the gold

53
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,899
and the crown would
pay us back in time

54
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:12,037
or I'd have words
with my daughter.

55
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,009
You've already
given us too much.

56
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:22,681
No, we must arrange better
terms with the Iron Bank.

57
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,917
- Absolutely.
- In person.

58
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,187
- Me?
- We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

59
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,758
someone of importance to show
these bankers our respect.

60
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,595
As the king's Master of Coin, I can
think of no one more qualified.

61
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,929
I would be honored, Your Grace.

62
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:43,602
The king's expressed concern about his
father-in-law's safety on this voyage.

63
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:50,876
He's ordered Ser Meryn to
personally lead your escort.

64
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,545
My very own Kingsguard?

65
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,214
- Please express my...
- Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

66
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,883
Of course. Of course.

67
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:02,587
I'll give your regards
to the Titan of Braavos.

68
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,823
( laughs )

69
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:14,566
The small council grows
smaller and smaller.

70
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,469
Not small enough.

71
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:30,482
Cersei: May I offer you
some wine, Your Holiness?

72
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,517
No.

73
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,322
The old High Septon would
have asked the vintage.

74
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:41,159
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven

75
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,261
and should be kept pure.

76
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:47,232
But the truth is
I don't like the taste.

77
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,167
Hmm.

78
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,070
How may I serve?

79
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:56,208
All over Westeros we hear
of septs being burned,

80
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,010
Silent Sisters raped,

81
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,012
bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

82
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:05,217
Wars teach people to obey
the sword, not the gods.

83
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:08,420
Perhaps the gods
need a sword of their own.

84
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,021
<i>In the days before
the Targaryens,

85
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,191
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

86
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:18,063
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

87
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:21,967
If I explain their holy
purpose to my son the king,

88
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,102
I have no doubt
he will sign a decree

89
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,704
arming the believers
you felt worthy.

90
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:30,775
An army that defends the bodies
and souls of the common people?

91
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,745
An army in service
to the gods themselves.

92
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,847
And to you, of course,

93
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,583
as the chosen representative
of the Seven.

94
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,052
An honor I never expected.

95
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,921
Or, indeed, ever wished for.

96
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,290
Which is why you were chosen.

97
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,994
You and I both know
how the world works.

98
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,229
Too often the wicked
are the wealthiest,

99
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,430
beyond the reach of justice.

100
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:56,735
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

101
00:08:56,737 --> 00:09:00,839
All sinners are equal
before the gods.

102
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:08,880
What would you say if I told you of
a great sinner in our very midst?

103
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,717
Shielded by gold and privilege.

104
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:17,155
May the Father judge him justly.

105
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,661
( Merchants shouting )

106
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,401

Loras: Get your hands off me.

Ser Loras of House Tyrell,

137
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:44,002
you have broken the laws
of gods and men.

138
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,871
Who do you think you are?

139
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,774
Justice.

140
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,149
Why is my brother in a cell?

141
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,518
I-I don't know.

142
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,253
I-I didn't order it.

143
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,122
We both know who did.

144
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:08,393
You told me she was
returning to Casterly Rock.

145
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,595
Are you saying
my mother's behind this?

146
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,630
She's jealous
you're not hers anymore.

147
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:16,101
<i>Arresting my brother
is her revenge.

148
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,937
Aren't you and Mother
getting along?

149
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,306
( Huffs )

150
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:28,813
Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

151
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:33,818
Do you have any affection
for me at all?

152
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,421
Of course I do.

153
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,022
You're my queen.

154
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,358
I can't bear
to think of my brother

155
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,095
locked away in some grimy cell.

156
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,099
I'll set him free for you.

157
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,034
Do you promise?

158
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:59,077
I demand that
Ser Loras be freed now.

159
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,279
Did I arrest him?

160
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,349
Well, no.

161
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,651
But y-you armed
the Faith Militant.

162
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:11,022
You gave the High Sparrow
an army.

163
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,557
I did.

164
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,194
And your wife has
every right to criticize.

165
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,631
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother

166
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,634
no matter his perversions.

167
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,136
Then...

168
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,939
can I tell Margaery you'll
have Ser Loras released?

169
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,242
I told you,
I'm not holding Ser Loras.

You're the king.

171
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,546
I'm sure if you speak
to the High Sparrow,

172
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:37,949
he'll release the poor boy.

173
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,823

He was praying just now.

I have to send word
to Grandmother.

Will you come back later?

198
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:45,109
I need to be with
my family, Your Grace.

199
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,513
Of course.

Good.

Stannis: Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

204
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,755
And a bastard
by some tavern slut.

205
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:01,993
Perhaps, but that
wasn't Ned Stark's way.

206
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,632
I should have given you a son.

207
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,668
Not your fault.

208
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,236
Whose, then?

209
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:15,540
I gave you nothing but weakness.

210
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,078
And deformity.

211
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,648
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

212
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,149
My lady.

213
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,685
Her father is the Lord's
chosen king,

214
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:31,422
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

215

You march on Winterfell soon?

216
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:46,137
We must to beat the snows.

217
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,273
Once before, you put
your faith in Ser Davos

218
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,743
and left me behind.

219
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,314
I hope you won't make
that mistake again.

220
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,182
I won't.

221
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,652
I need you.

222
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:05,623
You only need faith, my king.

223
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,396

Oh, Lord Smallwood.

229
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,919
I've never even heard
of these people.

230
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,588
They haven't heard
of you, either.

231
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,059
But we need men
and they have some.

232
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:45,496
How many men does this
Lord Mayzen have to send us?

233
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,599
More than Lord Wibberley.

234
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,481
- Not him.
- <i> I know, I'm sorry.

We swore to be
the watchers on the Wall.

We can't watch the Wall

And we can't get more men

241

the Warden of the North.

242
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,490

its people.

00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,785
Winterfell was your home once.

Don't you want to chase
the rats out of it?

252
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,959
Castle Black is my home now.

<i>The Night's Watch take no part in

Life against death.

00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:35,606
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

257

You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

258

Forgive me, my lady,
I don't trust in visions.

259
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,518
No visions. No magic.

260
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,754
Just life.

261
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,343

There's power in you.

263

You resist it,

Embrace it.

265
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,798

Power to make life,

power to make light,

270
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,547
and power to cast shadows.

271
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,751
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

272
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,854
Then we shouldn't tell him.

273
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,891
- I can't.
- Why?

274
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,761

Only the living.

00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,479
But I still love her.

Just bored.

284
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,205
My father used
to tell me that boredom

285
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,973
indicates a lack
of inner resources.

286
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,875
Were you bored a lot, too?

287
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:27,144
I know Castle Black

is no place for a child, but...

289
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:32,149
I like it. I thought
I'd be left at home.

290

I know Mother
didn't want to bring me.

291
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:38,022
Why do you say that?

292
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,592
She told me, "I don't
want to bring you."

293
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,995
She shouldn't have said that.

294
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,041
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

295
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,187
When you were an infant,

296
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:13,624
a Dornish trader
landed on Dragonstone.

297
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:17,862
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

298
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:22,900
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

299
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:26,137
No doubt he had
heard of your birth

300
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:30,541
and assumed new fathers
were easy targets.

301
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:37,047
I still remember how you smiled when
I put that doll in your cradle.

302
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,051
How you pressed it
to your cheek.

303
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:50,494
By the time we burned the
doll, it was too late.

304
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:55,099
I was told you would die.

305
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,902
Or worse,

306
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,303

Sometimes I'd find him down
here lighting the candles.

They say she was beautiful.

326
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,693
I saw her once.

00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:05,996
I was a boy living
with your mother's family.

328
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:10,301
Lord Whent held a great

She was already
promised to Robert.

334
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,380
You can imagine
what it was like for me,

335
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:27,384
a boy from nowhere
with nothing to his name,

336
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,320
watching these legendary men

tilting at the lists.

338
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,259
The last two riders

340
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:40,230
When Rhaegar won, everyone
cheered for their prince.

341
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,933
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet

342
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,235
and they saw that silver hair.

343
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,237
How handsome he was.

344
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,708
Until he rode
right past his wife,

345

Elia Martell,

346
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,912

I've never seen
so many people so quiet.

348
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:02,052
He rode past his wife

349
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:06,790
and he lay a crown of winter
roses in Lyanna's lap.

350
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,660
Blue as frost.

351

thousands had to die

353
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:21,105
Yes, he chose her.

354
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:24,908
And then he kidnapped
her and raped her.

355
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,484
Come.

356
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:37,221
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

357
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,727
You're dressed for riding.

358
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:46,096
I am.

359
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,032
Where are you going?

360
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,100
King's Landing.

361
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,169
King's Landing?

362
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,303
Cersei sent for me.

363
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,240
We mustn't let her
sniff out any trouble.

364
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,307
You can't leave me here.

365
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,844
I know how hard it is to live
with people you despise.

366
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,246
Believe me.

367
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:04,314
But it won't be for long.

368
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,116
How do you know?

369
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:10,320
Stannis Baratheon
garrisons at Castle Black.

370
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,322
He'll march south
to King's Landing

371
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,391
before the winter snows
block his way.

372
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,928
But first he has
to take Winterfell.

373
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,464
- You don't know that.
- I do.

374
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:23,100
Once he liberates these
lands from the Boltons,

375
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,103
he'll rally your father's
bannermen to his cause.

376
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,671
With the North behind him,

377
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:30,441
Stannis can finally take
the Iron Throne.

378
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:33,844
You think he'll
defeat the Boltons?

379
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:34,978
He has a larger army.

380
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,214
He's the finest military
commander in Westeros.

381
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:41,285
A betting man would put
his money on Stannis.

382
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:44,955
As it happens,
I am a betting man.

383
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,224
And if you're right?

384
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,592
Stannis takes Winterfell,

385
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:51,528
he rescues you from the most
despised family in the North.

386
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,332
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

387
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:58,469
he names you
Wardeness of the North.

388
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,838
But I...

389
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,239
I wouldn't...

390
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,507
Wardeness of the North?

391
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,944
You are the last
surviving Stark.

392
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,445
He needs you.

393
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:09,413
And what if you're wrong?

394
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,215
What if Stannis never
attacks Winterfell?

395
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,917
Or he does and the
Boltons defeat him?

396
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,386
Then you will take
this Bolton boy, Ramsay,

397
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,155
and make him yours.

398
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,224
I don't know how to do that.

399
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,859
Of course you do.

400
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,861
He's already fallen for you.

401
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,462
His father frightens me.

402
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,465
He should. He's a dangerous man.

403
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:32,369
But even the most dangerous
men can be outmaneuvered.

404
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:36,240
And you've learned to
maneuver from the very best.

405
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:40,444
I'll return before too long.

406
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:44,047
You'll be strong without me.

407
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,924
The North will be yours.

408
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:57,227
Do you believe me?

409
00:29:57,496 --> 00:30:03,300
I expect I'll be a married
woman by the time you return.

410
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,503
( Pats )

411
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,007
( groans )

412
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,910
( panting )

413
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,925
<i>( blade scraping )

414
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:08,565
Breakfast.

415
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,603
That would have been
a shit way to die.

416
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:15,606
As far as I've seen, they're
all shit ways to die.

417
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:19,409
Aye, but your lot have to give
the singers a good ending.

418
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:22,946
I don't care what's sung
about me when I'm dead.

419
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,248
No?

420
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,117
Two knights off
to rescue a princess.

421
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,052
Sounds like a good song to me.

422
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,321
Sounds like all the rest.

423
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,026
What about you?

424
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:39,429
What shit way would you choose?

425
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:42,599
In my own keep
drinking my own wine

426
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,903
watching my sons
grovel for my fortune.

427
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,238
How disappointing.

428
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,808
I thought you'd have something
more exciting planned.

429
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,111
I've had an exciting life.

430
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:57,114
I want my death to be boring.

431
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,650
How do you want to go?

432
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:03,053
In the arms of the woman I love.

433
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,691
She want the same thing?

434
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:15,432
Let's go.

435
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,977
The captain of that ship...

436
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,645
What was he, Braavosi?

437
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,147
Pentoshi.

438
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,082
And he's headed to Oldtown?

439
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:33,383
As I said. Why?

440
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,086
What's to stop him from
docking down the coast

441
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:39,456
and telling the locals that
Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

442
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,291
A bag of gold.

443
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,392
I'm not sure you understand

444
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,796
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

445
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:46,863
It was a heavy bag.

446
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:50,300
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

447
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,402
But you won't be around
if he breaks 'em.

448
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:56,006
<i>- ( Horse neighs )
- ( hoofbeats )

449
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,348
Bronn: <i>How many you count?

450
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,215
Four.

451
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,284
How many do you think
you can take?

452
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,987
One if he's slow.

453
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,058
Halt!

454
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,294
Over the hill.

455
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:21,999
Fucked in the ass.

456
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,070
Hyah!

457
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,776
Morning, lads.

458
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:35,145
Glad we found you.

459
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,513
Who are you?

460
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,382
Cooper.

461
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,816
This is Darnell.

462
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,718
You're from King's Landing.

463
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,654
Accent gave me away?

464
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,391
Flea Bottom,
whelped and whipped.

465
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,425
Why are you here?

466
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:50,560
Our ship capsized in the night.

467
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,195
We managed to swim ashore.

468
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,132
It was a near thing, really.

469
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:57,434
Thought the sharks would get us.

470
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:01,338
There are no sharks in Dorne.

471
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,475
Could have sworn
those were shark fins.

472
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,677
Dolphins, maybe.

473
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,946
Throw your swords in the sand.

474
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,449
Boys, there's no need for this.

475
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:15,685
Just point us
in the right direction,

476
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,320
we'll find our way home.

477
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:20,290
Swords in the sand now.

478
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,069
( Grunts )

479
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:42,646
Hyah! Hyah!

480
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,183
( Horse neighs )

481
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:50,187
That one should be slow enough.

482
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,427
( Shouts )

483
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:30,193
( shouts )

484
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:41,838
( grunts )

485
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:45,509
Bronn: <i>Nice move.

486
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,411
Luck.

487
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:51,348
You had a wonderful teacher.

488
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,796
Always wanted
a Dornish stallion.

489
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:10,767
Beasts can run a day and
night without tiring.

490
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,402
We'll ride to the Water Gardens

491
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,637
with a nice breeze in our faces.

492
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,773
First we need
to bury these bodies.

493
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:17,807
Birds have to eat, too.

494
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,477
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

495
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,546
We're not here to start a war.

496
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:25,715
Do you know how long it'll take
us to dig all those holes?

497
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:29,419
I can't dig very well
with one hand.

498
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,355
Not at all, really.

499
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:04,688
Mama.

500
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,328
Nym, Obara.

501
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,462
Will it be war?

502
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:15,565
Prince Doran will weep for
your father, but nothing else.

503
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,434
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

504
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:21,004
Without Doran, we have no army
to march against the Lannisters.

505
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:23,907
We don't need an army
to start a war.

506
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,978
<i>Queen Cersei loves her children.

507
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,946
And we have one of them.

508
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,549
You may have a problem.

509
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:37,921
( Groaning )

510
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,056
A ship's captain who
found me in Planky Town

511
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,625
claiming he had
information to sell.

512
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:46,696
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

513
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:50,100
He's come for Myrcella.

514
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,102
If he gets to her before we do,

515
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:55,538
we lose our only chance
for revenge.

516
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,708
You must choose.

517
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,577
Doran's way and peace,

518
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:04,514
or my way and war.

519
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:09,653
I'm with you always.

520
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,888
Nym?

521
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,726
Obara?

522
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:21,131
When I was a child, Oberyn
came to take me to court.

523
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,699
I had never seen this man,

524
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:25,669
and yet he called
himself my father.

525
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:26,770
My mother wept,

526
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:30,740
said I was too young and a girl.

527
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:35,512
Oberyn tossed his spear
at my feet and said,

528
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,214
"Girl or boy,
we fight our battles,

529
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:41,818
but the gods let us
choose our weapons."

530
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,587
My father pointed to the spear

531
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,324
and then to my mother's tears.

532
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,461
( Grunts )

533
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:57,334
I made my choice long ago.

534
00:38:57,703 --> 00:39:01,638
( Tyrion muffled )
Will you untie me?

535
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,774
<i>( Muffled )
Will you please untie me?

536
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,744
( muffled groan )
Will you please?

537
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:14,751
( Muffled singing )

538
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:32,569
Thank you.

539
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,178
Who are you?

540
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,114
Your captor.

541
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,650
Do you have wine?

542
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,119
<i>No.

543
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:51,488
Can't sleep without wine.

544
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,857
Then stay awake.

545
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,498
You're going the wrong way.

546
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,701
My sister is in Westeros.

547
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:07,537
Westeros is west.

548
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:08,838
We're heading east.

549
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,142
<i>I'm not taking you
to your sister.

550
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:14,944
You said you were
taking me to the queen.

551
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,448
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

552
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,483
She's the queen I serve.

553
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:23,520
( laughing )

554
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:29,759
What a waste
of a good kidnapping.

555
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,728
It so happens I was
heading there myself.

556
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,597
What business would you
have with the queen?

557
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,901
Gold and glory. Oh, and hate.

558
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:41,237
If you'd ever met my sister,
you'd understand.

559
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:46,843
So, now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

560
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,888
<i>A highborn knight from
the North of Westeros

561
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,124
down on his luck in Essos.

562
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:06,229
Dragon epaulets,
bear sigil breastplate.

563
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:09,132
You're Jorah Mormont.

564
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,367
<i>I have to ask.

565
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,703
How exactly were you
serving your queen

566
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:16,639
in a whorehouse
half a world away?

567
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,542
Is it possible
that you were running?

568
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:21,845
Why would you be running?

569
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,681
And why would she
have sent you away?

570
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:27,183
Oh, wait.

571
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,320
You were spying
on her, weren't you?

572
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,788
<i>It's all coming back to me.

573
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,958
I was drunk through most of
the small council meetings,

574
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,226
but it's all coming back.

575
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:40,330
You passed notes
to Varys's little birds.

576
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:43,867
<i>She found out, didn't she?

577
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,836
<i>Found out and exiled you.

578
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:52,242
Now you hope to win back
her favor with a gift.

579
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,110
Risky scheme.

580
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:57,780
<i>One might even say desperate.

581
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:02,752
You think Daenerys will
execute me and pardon you?

582
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:06,656
I'd say the reverse
is just as likely.

583
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,743
<i>( Bird screeches )

584
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:30,580
Everyone looks happy
enough from up here.

585
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,182
- ( laughs )
- What?

586
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:35,184
I was thinking about
all the times your brother

587
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,453
made me go with him
down from the Red Keep

588
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:38,988
into the streets
of King's Landing.

589
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,191
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

590
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,093
He liked to sing to them.

591
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,962
He sang to them?

592
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,897
- Yes.
- ( laughs )

593
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,033
Rhaegar would pick
a spot on the Hook

594
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:53,269
or the Street of Seeds
and then he'd sing.

595
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,204
Just like all
the other minstrels.

596
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,206
And what did you do?

597
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,007
I made sure no one killed him.

598
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,476
And I collected the money.

599
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:03,246
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

600
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,715
- He was good?
- He was very good.

601
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:06,883
Viserys never told you?

602
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:10,320
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

603
00:43:10,322 --> 00:43:12,255
Rhaegar never liked killing.

604
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,156
He loved singing.

605
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,524
And what did you do
with the money?

606
00:43:14,526 --> 00:43:18,061
Well, one time, he gave it to the
next minstrel down the street.

607
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:21,130
One time, he gave it to an
orphanage in Flea Bottom.

608
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:25,368
One time, we got horribly drunk.

609
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,203
( laughs )

610
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:28,738
Your Grace.

611
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,976
Hizdahr is here, waiting
in the audience chamber.

612
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:35,078
How many others are there?

613
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,380
50? 100?

614
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:39,182
Will you be joining us,
Ser Barristan?

615
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:43,019
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

616
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:47,190
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

617
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:48,858
Go, Ser Barristan.

618
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,360
Sing a song for me.

619
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:53,096
Your Grace.

620
00:43:56,835 --> 00:44:00,770
All men must die, but not
all can die in glory.

621
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,538
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

622
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,108
Why did your ancestors
cross the Narrow Sea

623
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,809
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

624
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,978
So their names would live on.

625
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,346
Those who find victory
in the fighting pits

626
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:14,150
will never become kings,
but their names will live on.

627
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,185
It's the best chance
they'll ever have.

628
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,420
Is that what
you used to tell men

629
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,622
before you set them to
butchering each other for sport?

630
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:23,459
Your Grace, today is the traditional
start of the fighting season.

631
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:24,961
I do not recognize
this tradition.

632
00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:29,032
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

633
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:31,034
your city, together.

634
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:34,270
Without them, former
slaves and former masters

635
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:36,572
have nothing in common.

636
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:41,577
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

637
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:46,215
<i>I can't promise this is the
answer to all our problems,

638
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:49,085
but it's a start.

639
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:27,156
( speaking Valyrian )
