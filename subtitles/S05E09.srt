110

00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:13,631
You write like a seven-year-old.

533
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,301
You think I disapprove?

534
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:17,601
Why?

535
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:17,900
You think I disapprove?

536
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,536
Because people disapprove of that
sort of thing where you are from?

537
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,170
You think I disapprove?

538
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,990
They disapproved of Oberyn
and me where you are from.

539
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:24,808
You think I disapprove?

540
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,027
Here no one blinked an eye.

541
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:29,245
You think I disapprove?

542
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:30,781
100 years ago,

543
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,099
no one would have
blinked an eye at you

544
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,416
100 years ago,

545
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:34,835
if you'd been named Targaryen.

546
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,252
100 years ago,

547
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:42,226
It's always changing, who we're
supposed to love and who we're not.

548
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,795
The only thing
that stays the same

549
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,614
is that we want who we want.

550
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:48,432
The only thing
that stays the same

551
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,777
I know your daughter had no
part in the terrible thing

552
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,362
that happened to the man I love.

553
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,483
I know your daughter had no
part in the terrible thing

554
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,951
Perhaps even you
are innocent of that.

- "The Dance of Dragons."
- What's it about?

562
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:40,084
No. What are you reading?

563
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:41,202
It's the story of the fight
between Rhaenyra Targaryen

564
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,319
No. What are you reading?

565
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,188
And her half-brother Aegon for
control over the Seven Kingdoms.

566
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,056
No. What are you reading?

567
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,424
Both of them thought they
belonged on the Iron Throne.

568
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,791
No. What are you reading?

569
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,544

for one of them or the other,

570

No. What are you reading?

571
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:53,314
Their fight divided
the kingdoms in two.

572
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,331
No. What are you reading?

573
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,617
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

574
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:58,902
No. What are you reading?

575
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:03,340
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

576
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,192
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

577
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:07,043
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

578
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:08,396
They never truly recovered.

579
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:09,747
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

580
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,082
"The Dance of Dragons."

581
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,843
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

582
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,419
Why is that a dance?

583
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:16,153
It's just what they call it.

584
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:16,886
Why is that a dance?

585
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,172
Hmm, doesn't make much sense.

586
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,456
Why is that a dance?

587
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:20,674
I think it's poetic.

588
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,891
Why is that a dance?

589
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,434
If you had to choose

590
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,453
between Rhaenyra and Aegon...

591
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,471
If you had to choose

592
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,207
who would you have chosen?

593
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:37,992
I wouldn't have chosen either.

594
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:38,776
Who would you have chosen?

595
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,795
It's all the choosing sides that
made everything so horrible.

596
00:29:40,796 --> 00:29:42,813
Who would you have chosen?

597
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,331
Sometimes a person
has to choose.

598
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:45,848
Who would you have chosen?

599
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,188
Sometimes the world
forces his hand.

600
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:56,226
If a man knows what he is...

601
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:00,297
and remains true to himself...

602
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:05,269
the choice is no choice at all.

603
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,271
He must fulfill his destiny...

604
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,272
the choice is no choice at all.

605
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,545
And become
who he is meant to be.

606
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:19,449
However much he may hate it.

607
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,186
It's all right, Father.

608
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,088
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

609
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,989
It's all right, Father.

610
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:26,774
It doesn't matter.

611
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:27,558
It's all right, Father.

612
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,559
I want to help you.

613
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
It's all right, Father.

614
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:30,911
Is there any way I can help?

615
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,261
It's all right, Father.

616
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,138
Yes, there is.

617
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,256
Good. I want to.

618
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,373
Yes, there is.

619
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:48,011
I'm the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

620
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,296
And I'm your daughter.

It will all be over
