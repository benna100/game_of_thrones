1
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:09,806
- We shouldn't be out here alone.
- Why not?

2
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,775
- If your father...
- He'll never know we're gone.

3
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:15,081
But if he finds out...

4
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:21,493
You don't need
to be afraid of my father.

5
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,904
Are you sure?

6
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:52,542
Yes.

7
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:55,941
- We shouldn't go in.
- Of course we should.

8
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,240
Get out. Get out!

9
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:45,206
- Let's go.
- No.

10
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,070
Listen to your friend.

11
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:50,877
They said that you
were terrifying

12
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:54,141
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

13
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:56,277
You're not terrifying.

14
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:59,453
You're boring.

15
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:01,749
You don't know what I am.

16
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,124
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

17
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,323
Tell me mine.

18
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:10,563
Everyone wants
to know their future

19
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:12,658
until they know their future.

20
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,959
This is my father's land.
My land.

21
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:19,796
Tell me my future
or I'll have your two boring eyes

22
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,500
gouged out of your head.

23
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,405
Your blood.

24
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,270
Give me a taste.

25
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,683
Three questions you get.

26
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:05,483
You won't like the answers.

27
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:12,555
I've been promised
to the prince.

28
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,659
When will we marry?

29
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:16,530
You will never wed the prince.

30
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:18,393
You will wed the king.

31
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:19,960
But I will be queen?

32
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:22,295
Oh, yes.

33
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,767
You'll be queen.

34
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:27,470
For a time.

35
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,732
Then comes another,

36
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,132
younger,

37
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:33,636
<i>more beautiful,

38
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:37,877
<i>to cast you down
and take all you hold dear.

39
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:40,245
W-will the king and I
have children?

40
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:44,053
No. The king
will have 20 children

41
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,685
and you will have three.

42
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,853
That doesn't make sense.

43
00:05:46,887 --> 00:05:50,221
Gold will be their crowns.

44
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:53,357
Gold their shrouds.

45
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,933
Girl: Come on, we have to go.

46
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:05,299
We have to go! Cersei!

47
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:11,271
<i>Man: Bearers, put it down.

48
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,057
<i>Man: Bearers, up.

49
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:31,896
<i>Away.

50
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,212
<i>High Septon: Your Grace, we are
honored by your presence.

51
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:49,614
<i>The mourners are waiting.

52
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:52,455
They will keep waiting.

53
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:54,055
I want a moment alone with him.

54
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,623
But, Your Grace, many of these lords
and ladies have travelled

55
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,959
day and night to be here from
all seven kingdoms.

56
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:00,728
They will wait.

57
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:29,823
He never wanted you
to be a Kingsguard,

58
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:33,864
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

59
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,676
What he built, it's ours.

60
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:43,783
He built it for us.
He meant it for us.

61
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:47,351
They're going to try
to take it away.

62
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,655
- All of it.
- They?

63
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:51,223
All of them out there,
our enemies.

64
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:54,063
They're waiting in line
to make sure he's really dead.

65
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:55,895
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

66
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,767
they'll set to work
on tearing us apart.

67
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,568
They have nothing to do with it.

68
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:02,736
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

69
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,168
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

70
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:06,808
You've been defending
him for years.

71
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:08,376
This is exactly what they want.

72
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,208
And now our father is dead

73
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:13,680
and that little monster is out there
somewhere drawing breath.

74
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,921
Did you set him free?

75
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:22,153
Tyrion may be a monster,

76
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:26,161
but at least he killed
our father on purpose.

77
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:28,265
You killed him by mistake.

78
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,329
With stupidity.

79
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,201
You're a man
of action, aren't you?

80
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:35,472
When it occurs to you
to do something, you do it.

81
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:38,704
Never mind the consequences.

82
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:43,206
Take a look.

83
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,141
Look at the consequences.

84
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:49,316
Here they are.

85
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,449
He loved you more than
anyone in this world.

86
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:30,578
Apologies.

87
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:43,624
I still don't see
why I had to stay

88
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:46,696
in this fucking crate
once we set sail.

89
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,632
I saved your life.

90
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,431
If they catch you,
they catch me.

91
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,471
I cannot say
I feel overly guilty

92
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:55,535
about leaving you
in that fucking crate.

93
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:58,302
Do you know what it's like
to stuff your shit

94
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:00,038
through one of those airholes?

95
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,006
No, I only know what it's like

96
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:04,584
to pick up your shit
and throw it overboard.

97
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,855
Pentos?

98
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:13,420
The home of my colleague
Illyrio Mopatis,

99
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:14,924
a merchant.

100
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,891
He and I met many years ago

101
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,027
through mutual friends.

102
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:21,531
A group of people
who saw Robert Baratheon

103
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,900
for the disaster he was.

104
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,132
We tried to do what
was best for the realm

105
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,573
by supporting
a Targaryen restoration.

106
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:32,278
And thus began
the chain of mistakes

107
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:34,775
that has led us both here.

108
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:38,350
Things have gotten worse,
not better.

109
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:41,652
Westeros needs to be
saved from itself.

110
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:47,123
Mmm.

111
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:48,691
Much better.

112
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,491
My lord?

113
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:55,131
I don't think I am anymore.

114
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,531
A lord.

115
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:08,105
Are you a lord
if you kill your father?

116
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,112
I don't imagine
they revoke your nobility

117
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:15,079
for killing a whore.

118
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:16,813
It must happen all the time.

119
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,349
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

120
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:21,318
In a box. Why stop now?

121
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:24,592
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

122
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,266
The future is shit.

123
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:35,339
Just like the past.

124
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:57,417
Shh.

125
00:14:57,451 --> 00:14:59,217
Shh.

126
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,397
<i>Daenerys: The Sons of the Harpy?

127
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,668
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

128
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:48,131
They've never killed before.

129
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:50,539
It was only a matter
of time, Your Grace.

130
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:52,938
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

131
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:55,208
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

132
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:06,219
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

133
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:08,220
so cowards in masks
could take it away.

134
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:10,124
And I did not take up
residence in this pyramid

135
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:13,997
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

136
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:16,630
What was the name
of the man you lost?

137
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:19,206
White Rat, Your Grace.

138
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,340
I want him buried
with honor, publically

139
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,675
in the Temple of the Graces.

140
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,906
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

141
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,473
Make them very angry.

142
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,441
Angry snakes lash out.

143
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:34,207
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

144
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:37,782
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

145
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:43,083
Your Grace.

146
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:58,463
Torgo Nudho.

147
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,527
Missandei hin Naath.

148
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,202
I wanted to speak with you.

149
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:15,111
Why do you come?

150
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:18,311
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

151
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:23,718
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

152
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:27,617
I have heard that
more than one Unsullied

153
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:30,584
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

154
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:35,190
May I ask you why?

155
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:39,262
Why would an Unsullied
go to a brothel?

156
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:45,670
I do not know.

157
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:49,302
<i>I must go.

158
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:06,992
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

159
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:08,624
If it wasn't heavy,
it wouldn't stop a sword.

160
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,295
Now get it up.

161
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:25,195
Come. Try it again.

162
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,298
Drive at me.
Keep your shield up.

163
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:30,634
Or I'll ring
your head like a bell.

164
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,505
Shouldn't you be training, too?

165
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,138
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

166
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,779
How many brothers can say that they've
killed a white walker and a Thenn?

167
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:44,883
I might be the first in history.

168
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,019
<i>- Man: Shield up.
- Alliser: These men need a firm hand.

169
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:48,820
Always have.

170
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:51,995
They're poachers and thieves.

171
00:18:53,726 --> 00:18:55,660
Not soldiers.

172
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:03,293
That one hates me.

173
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:07,299
Sam: If Ser Alliser is chosen
as the new Lord Commander...

174
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:11,035
- He hates the wildlings.

175
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:12,666
All the wildlings.

176
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,137
<i>- Don't let them send us away.
- It's not a sure thing.

177
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:17,979
Ser Denys Mallister has commanded
the Shadow Tower for 20 years

178
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:19,643
and people say he's a good man.

179
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:20,947
He's running against
Ser Alliser...

180
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:23,652
Sam, don't let them
send us away.

181
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,652
I told you.

182
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,956
Wherever you go, I go, too.

183
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,420
You can't leave.
They'll execute you.

184
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:41,036
- Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
- Yah!

185
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:44,004
Shield up.

186
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:47,572
The king wants a word.

187
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:17,062
You're not cold, my lady?

188
00:20:17,104 --> 00:20:19,998
Never.

189
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,438
The Lord's fire lives
within me, Jon Snow.

190
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,880
Feel.

191
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,952
Are you a virgin?

192
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,594
No.

193
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,961
Good.

194
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:55,070
Your Grace.

195
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,468
The bastard of Winterfell.

196
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,278
You know who rules
at Winterfell now?

197
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:10,814
Roose Bolton.

198
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:14,484
Mmm, the traitor who plunged
a dagger in Robb Stark's heart.

199
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:17,914
Don't you want to avenge him?

200
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:21,955
I want a great
many things, Your Grace.

201
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:24,556
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

202
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,829
I've been talking
to your sworn brothers.

203
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,797
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

204
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,469
<i>Many don't.

205
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:35,573
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

206
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:37,108
<i>Why?

207
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:38,940
It's where she belonged.

208
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:40,571
Some of the Night's
Watch feel you have

209
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:42,578
too much affection
for the wildlings.

210
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:45,113
They were born
on the wrong side of the Wall.

211
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:47,145
That doesn't make them monsters.

212
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:48,376
No matter.

213
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:49,846
I shall take back the North

214
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,308
from the thieves who stole it.

215
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,779
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

216
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,451
I shall mount
Roose Bolton's head on a spike.

217
00:21:57,485 --> 00:22:00,020
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

218
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:02,954
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part...

219
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,154
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

220
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:07,191
I'm talking about the wildlings.

221
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:19,037
Your Grace,
you want the wildlings

222
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:20,878
to march in your army?

223
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:22,942
If they swear to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

224
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:24,781
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

225
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:26,684
I'll declare them
citizens of the realm.

226
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:28,884
I'll give them land to live on.

227
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:32,219
It's a fair offer.
More than fair.

228
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:34,187
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

229
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:37,225
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

230
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,024
I don't think that's likely.

231
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,496
You admire him, don't you?

232
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:45,329
- I respect him.
- He likes you.

233
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,265
- Convince him to bend the knee...
- Your Grace.

234
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,769
Or he burns.

235
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:54,042
How much time do I have?

236
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:55,577
Nightfall.

237
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:58,009
The sun drops fast
this time of year.

238
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,546
<i>Hurry, Jon Snow.

239
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,650
<i>Master-of-arms: Shield up.

240
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,721
<i>Master-of-arms: Attack, my lord!

241
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:09,825
Attack!

242
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:12,518
Don't cross your feet.

243
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,325
My sons had swords
in their hands

244
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,820
from the time they could walk.
This one...

245
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,154
<i>Littlefinger: Lord Arryn will never
be a great warrior.

246
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,163
<i>Royce: Great warrior?

247
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:22,858
He swings a sword
like a girl with palsy.

248
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,593
My lord.

249
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,498
<i>Master-of-arms:
Sword up, my lord!

250
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:37,011
Some boys develop more slowly.

251
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:39,241
He's still young.

252
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:42,344
He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.

253
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,385
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

254
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:47,217
The gift of a great name.

255
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:51,025
Sometimes that's all one needs.

256
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,606
Good-bye, Lord Royce,
and thank you for all you've done for me.

257
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,071
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

258
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:02,944
I have no doubt
that on my return,

259
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:05,310
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

260
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,445
He'll be safe here.

261
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,413
<i>As for his skills,

262
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:12,852
I make no promises.

263
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,732
Will we head north
at some point?

264
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:32,171
He said Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

265
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:34,667
We're a few days' ride
from the Kingsroad.

266
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:37,170
- But that will take us...
- Us?

267
00:24:38,971 --> 00:24:41,376
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

268
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,344
told me you weren't
safe in the capital.

269
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:48,184
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

270
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:50,182
No one knows what you look like.

271
00:24:50,216 --> 00:24:53,316
No one cares. You're safe.

272
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,350
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

273
00:24:57,992 --> 00:24:59,591
An attendant to a knight.

274
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,223
I'm not a knight.

275
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:03,432
That means you're not a squire.

276
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:04,730
Well, where would I go?

277
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:07,634
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

278
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,251
You swore to find
the Stark girls.

279
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:20,882
I found Arya.
She didn't want my protection.

280
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:23,480
<i>- Sansa still might.
- Will you shut your mouth?

281
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:26,486
I didn't ask for your advice.

282
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,991
I don't want anyone
following me.

283
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:32,727
I'm not a leader.

284
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:35,726
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

285
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,895
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

286
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,080
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

287
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:54,248
I did.

288
00:25:54,282 --> 00:25:57,350
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

289
00:25:57,384 --> 00:25:59,550
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

290
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,494
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

291
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:06,788
but he's not alone
in that castle.

292
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,827
Do you trust all those
knights and ladies,

293
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,026
<i>stable boys and serving girls?

294
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,234
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

295
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:16,561
No.

296
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:18,264
But I pay them well

297
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:20,702
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

298
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:22,999
So where are we going?

299
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,336
To a land where
you trust everyone?

300
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:27,943
To a land so far from here,

301
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:31,046
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

302
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:42,286
It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.

303
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:47,626
Your father was a...

304
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,793
A force to be reckoned with.

305
00:26:49,827 --> 00:26:51,760
He truly was.

306
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:54,095
I wouldn't presume to claim

307
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,160
to have known him as such, but...

308
00:26:56,202 --> 00:26:59,803
<i>But just being in his presence
was enough to make it so clear

309
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:02,877
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

310
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:06,380
What a... what a force
to be reckoned with.

311
00:27:08,046 --> 00:27:10,548
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

312
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:17,492
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

313
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:20,521
This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.

314
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,793
I often warned...

315
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:27,694
Your Grace.

316
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:32,826
Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.

317
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,065
My deepest sympathies.

318
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,169
I apologize for my son's
appearance.

319
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:40,002
Uncle, it's quite all right.

320
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:44,842
They call themselves sparrows.

321
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:47,410
Bloody fanatics.

322
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,410
Religion has its place,
of course,

323
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:52,082
but at a certain point...

324
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:55,249
They never would have come
to the capital when Tywin was alive.

325
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:56,985
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,

326
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:58,985
whatever it is.

327
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:01,592
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

328
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:22,472
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

329
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:26,007
It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.

330
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:30,710
What can I do for you?

331
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,677
You can forgive me.

332
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,549
What could you possibly
have done to warrant my forgiveness?

333
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,315
I led you into the darkness.

334
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,651
I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.

335
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:44,492
I tempted you into our...

336
00:28:44,526 --> 00:28:47,124
unnatural relations.

337
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,937
And, of course,
there was the king...

338
00:28:53,404 --> 00:28:55,474
his boar hunt.

339
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,537
His wine.

340
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,676
I don't know what
you're talking about.

341
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,308
I'm a different person now.

342
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:11,714
I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

343
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:13,250
<i>You can, too.

344
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,953
<i>They watch over all of us,

345
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,584
ready to dole out mercy

346
00:29:17,618 --> 00:29:19,215
or justice.

347
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,822
Their world is at hand.

348
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,126
I will pray for
your father's soul.

349
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:35,503
The day Tywin Lannister's
soul needs your help...

350
00:29:43,975 --> 00:29:46,677
- Olyvar: It looks like Dorne.
- Loras: It doesn't.

351
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,445
It does.

352
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:53,789
That's the...
That's the Sunspear bit right there.

353
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,493
And that's where
the mountains are.

354
00:29:57,527 --> 00:29:59,957
And over here is...

355
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:02,797
Is Sunsnake?

356
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:04,293
Stonespear?

357
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,901
Sandstone.

358
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:07,565
Yes.

359
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,899
Yes, Sandstone.

360
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,705
Just there.

361
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:14,736
Fine.

362
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:19,040
It's Dorne.

363
00:30:20,273 --> 00:30:22,406
We should go there.

364
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,712
I think we would
have a lovely time,

365
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:28,016
judging by my experience.

366
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:32,024
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

367
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:33,687
Anywhere but here.

368
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,732
We're late for dinner as it is.

369
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,029
You're very respectful.

370
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,965
I'm very hungry.

371
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:08,206
What's your name?

372
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:09,974
Olyvar, my lady.

373
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:11,647
I'm afraid my brother

374
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:15,449
is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.

375
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,231
My lady.

376
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:43,229
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit more discreet?

377
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:44,836
Why?

378
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,098
They all know about me anyway.

379
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:50,336
Everybody knows everything
about everyone.

380
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,671
What's the point in trying to keep
a secret in a place like this?

381
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:56,338
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

382
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,634
My intended? Please.

383
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:01,105
<i>Tywin's dead.

384
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:03,241
<i>That means no one
can force Cersei to marry me.

385
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:05,409
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

386
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:07,177
You think I want
that woman married to my brother?

387
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:11,049
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

388
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,417
Which means she stays
in King's Landing.

389
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:17,289
<i>Which means you're trapped here with
Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

390
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:18,993
Perhaps.

391
00:32:20,027 --> 00:32:22,026
Perhaps?

392
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,961
Perhaps.

393
00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:39,514
Eunuch, the Spider,

394
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:41,377
the Master of Whisperers.

395
00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:43,848
Imp, Half-man.

396
00:32:46,153 --> 00:32:48,348
There are faster ways
to kill yourself.

397
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:50,146
Not for a coward.

398
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,183
You are many things, my friend,

399
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:54,215
but not a coward.

400
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:00,256
You never told me
why you set me free.

401
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,190
Your brother asked me to.

402
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:04,830
Could have said no.

403
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:07,597
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

404
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:09,796
Not as dangerous
as releasing me.

405
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,565
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

406
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,303
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

407
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:17,777
I didn't do it for you.

408
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:19,810
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

409
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:23,219
A drunken dwarf will never be
the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

410
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,418
I don't believe in saviors.

411
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:29,153
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

412
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:33,059
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

413
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:36,331
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done with me.

414
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:39,497
You have many
admirable qualities,

415
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:41,000
self-pity is not one of them.

416
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:43,231
Any fool with a bit of luck

417
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:46,670
can find himself
born into power.

418
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:50,405
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

419
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:53,044
I'm not well-suited for work.

420
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:54,541
I think you are.

421
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,814
You have your father's
instincts for politics.

422
00:33:56,848 --> 00:33:58,278
And you have compassion.

423
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,383
Compassion? Yes.

424
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:04,888
I killed my lover
with my bare hands.

425
00:34:04,922 --> 00:34:07,930
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

426
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,764
I never said you were perfect.

427
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,944
What is it you want exactly?

428
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:15,944
Peace.

429
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:18,008
Prosperity.

430
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,384
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

431
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,751
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

432
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:26,349
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

433
00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:28,589
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

434
00:34:28,623 --> 00:34:31,125
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

435
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,060
Perhaps.

436
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:36,524
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

437
00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:38,491
we assume there's no other way.

438
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:41,868
<i>If you sat on the Iron Throne,

439
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:44,203
<i>would you spread misery
throughout the land?

440
00:34:44,237 --> 00:34:46,739
I will never sit
on the Iron Throne.

441
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:48,875
<i>No, you won't.

442
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,372
<i>But you could help another
climb those steps

443
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:53,780
and take that seat.

444
00:34:53,814 --> 00:34:57,013
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

445
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:59,052
but gentler than Stannis.

446
00:34:59,086 --> 00:35:02,925
A monarch who can intimidate
the high lords and inspire the people.

447
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:06,191
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

448
00:35:06,225 --> 00:35:08,064
and the right family name.

449
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,327
Good luck finding him.

450
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:13,598
Who said anything about "him"?

451
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:19,632
You have a choice, my friend.

452
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,831
You can stay here
at Illyrio's palace

453
00:35:21,873 --> 00:35:24,302
and drink yourself to death,

454
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:26,572
or you can ride with me
to Meereen,

455
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:28,136
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

456
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,701
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

457
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:36,766
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

458
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:49,983
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

459
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:53,289
Looks like your friends haven't
been behaving themselves.

460
00:35:56,158 --> 00:35:58,997
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

461
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,597
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

462
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:03,501
to a council of elders
made up of both

463
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:05,837
the freed men
and the former slaveholders.

464
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:09,142
All matters of consequence will be
brought to you for review.

465
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:10,742
Good.

466
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:12,582
They did ask
for some concessions.

467
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:14,982
Concessions?

468
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:17,246
Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.

469
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:20,182
I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.

470
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:23,391
<i>Hizdahr: Forgive me.
You're right, of course.

471
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:27,727
Still, it's easier to rule
happy subjects than angry ones.

472
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:29,927
I don't expect the Wise Masters
to be happy.

473
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:33,031
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

474
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,104
They do not ask
for the return of slavery.

475
00:36:36,138 --> 00:36:39,009
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

476
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,515
The fighting pits?

477
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:43,919
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

478
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:46,025
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

479
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:48,530
free men would fight free men.

480
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:51,227
<i>The pit fighters you liberated

481
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:53,299
<i>plead for this opportunity.

482
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,771
Bring some here
and ask them yourself.

483
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:56,867
No fighting pits.

484
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:58,971
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai

485
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:00,973
and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.

486
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:03,897
I do not respect the tradition of
human cockfighting.

487
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:04,717
If you could...

488
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:06,741
How many times must I say no
before you understand?

489
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,488
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

490
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,127
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

491
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:18,262
You should reopen
the fighting pits.

492
00:37:18,296 --> 00:37:20,165
What?

493
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,902
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

494
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:27,271
She liked to drink pear brandy.

495
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:30,542
The older she got,
the less she made selling her body,

496
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:32,845
the more she wanted to drink.

497
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:36,213
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

498
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:38,917
she fucked the night before.

499
00:37:38,951 --> 00:37:41,150
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:41,184 --> 00:37:43,918
Why? I was a bad child.

501
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:47,591
I wasn't big, but I was quick.

502
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,031
And I loved to fight.

503
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:51,032
So they sold me
to a man in Tolos

504
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:53,167
who trained fighters
for the pits.

505
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:55,903
I had my first match
when I was 16.

506
00:37:55,936 --> 00:37:57,806
You were sold into slavery,

507
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,372
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

508
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:01,926
and you're defending
the fighting pits?

509
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:06,306
I'm only here
because of those pits.

510
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,008
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

511
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:11,343
a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.

512
00:38:11,377 --> 00:38:13,047
Soon I was famous.

513
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:15,246
10,000 men and women
screamed my name

514
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,814
when I stepped into the pit.

515
00:38:16,848 --> 00:38:18,718
I made so much money
for my master,

516
00:38:18,752 --> 00:38:21,551
he set me free when he died.

517
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:23,391
I joined the Second Sons.

518
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,560
And then I met you.

519
00:38:30,962 --> 00:38:33,000
You're the queen.

520
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,832
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

521
00:38:35,874 --> 00:38:38,303
Everyone but me.

522
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:42,471
You've made thousands
of enemies all across the world.

523
00:38:42,513 --> 00:38:45,311
As soon as they see weakness,

524
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:47,511
they'll attack.

525
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:50,950
Show your strength here, now.

526
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:53,381
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

527
00:38:55,486 --> 00:38:59,092
Anyone with a chest full of gold
can buy an army of Unsullied.

528
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:02,827
You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.

529
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:04,859
You're the Mother of Dragons.

530
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:15,635
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

531
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:19,308
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

532
00:39:19,342 --> 00:39:22,116
For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.

533
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:29,187
I can't control them anymore.

534
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:33,923
A dragon queen with no dragons

535
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,059
is not a queen.

536
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,887
Viserion?

537
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:47,792
Rhaegal?

538
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:01,136
Easy. Easy.

539
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,471
Easy.

540
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:45,013
So here we are.

541
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:47,117
Here we are.

542
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:52,550
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

543
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:55,959
And now, for our last meeting...

544
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:00,696
This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.

545
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,265
No, but it will be.

546
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:07,937
You know what Stannis wants?

547
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:10,376
He wants me to bend the knee.

548
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,680
And he wants the free folk
to fight for him.

549
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:16,047
I'll give him this much,

550
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:17,310
he's bold.

551
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:18,950
Shouldn't a king be bold?

552
00:42:18,984 --> 00:42:21,014
<i>Oh, aye.

553
00:42:21,048 --> 00:42:24,119
I respect him.

554
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:25,559
If he gets what he wants,

555
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:28,127
I expect he'll be
a better ruler than the fools

556
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:31,263
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

557
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,864
But I'll never serve him.

558
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:36,664
You told me you weren't
here to conquer.

559
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:38,137
You told me your people
have bled enough.

560
00:42:38,171 --> 00:42:40,241
That's right.

561
00:42:40,275 --> 00:42:42,873
I don't want them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.

562
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:46,450
You spent your life
convincing 90 clans to come together

563
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:48,514
for the first time in history.

564
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:50,652
Thenns and Hornfoots,

565
00:42:50,686 --> 00:42:53,725
the ice-river clans,
even the giants.

566
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:57,726
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

567
00:42:57,768 --> 00:43:00,231
You didn't do it for glory.

568
00:43:00,265 --> 00:43:02,302
You brought them
together to save them

569
00:43:02,336 --> 00:43:03,933
<i>because none of them
will survive the winter,

570
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:05,636
<i>not if they're north
of the Wall.

571
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,835
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

572
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,740
Pride?

573
00:43:11,878 --> 00:43:14,508
Fuck my pride.

574
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:18,981
This isn't about that.

575
00:43:20,383 --> 00:43:24,086
Then bend the knee
and save your people.

576
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:29,158
They followed me
because they respected me.

577
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,928
Because they believed in me.

578
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,432
The moment I kneel
for a southern king, that's all gone.

579
00:43:33,466 --> 00:43:36,672
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

580
00:43:36,706 --> 00:43:39,873
How many women?
How many children?

581
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:43,113
And you won't go out and rescue
them because why?

582
00:43:43,147 --> 00:43:45,282
You're afraid of looking afraid.

583
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:48,386
Oh, I am afraid.

584
00:43:49,556 --> 00:43:51,258
No shame in that.

585
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,368
How will they do it? Beheading?

586
00:44:04,402 --> 00:44:06,303
Hanging?

587
00:44:09,674 --> 00:44:11,576
They'll burn you alive.

588
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:18,114
Bad way to go.

589
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:23,856
I'll be honest with you.

590
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,856
I don't want to die.

591
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,791
And burnt to death,

592
00:44:27,825 --> 00:44:29,958
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

593
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:32,662
scorched and screaming.

594
00:44:32,696 --> 00:44:34,695
But it's better than betraying

595
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:36,262
everything I believe.

596
00:44:36,296 --> 00:44:38,630
And what happens to your people?

597
00:44:38,672 --> 00:44:42,437
You preserve your dignity
and die standing

598
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,971
and they'll sing
songs about you.

599
00:44:45,004 --> 00:44:47,336
You'd rather burn than kneel.

600
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,103
The great hero.

601
00:44:50,777 --> 00:44:53,638
Until winter comes
and the white walkers come for us all

602
00:44:53,672 --> 00:44:56,607
and there's no one left to sing.

603
00:44:58,944 --> 00:45:01,318
You're a good lad.

604
00:45:01,352 --> 00:45:04,254
Truly you are.

605
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:08,684
But if you can't understand
why I won't enlist my people

606
00:45:08,726 --> 00:45:11,292
in a foreigner's war,

607
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:13,525
there's no point explaining.

608
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,976
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

609
00:45:33,673 --> 00:45:36,278
The freedom to make
my own mistakes

610
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:38,246
was all I ever wanted.

611
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,278
Mance Rayder, you've been called
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

612
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:54,077
Westeros only has one king.

613
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,581
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

614
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:12,265
Kneel and live.

615
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:23,412
This was my home for many years.

616
00:47:25,015 --> 00:47:27,445
I wish you good fortune

617
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,421
in the wars to come.

618
00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:13,492
We all must choose.

619
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:18,163
Man or woman, young or old,

620
00:48:18,204 --> 00:48:21,499
lord or peasant,
our choices are the same.

621
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,107
We choose light
or we choose darkness.

622
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:28,139
<i>We choose good
or we choose evil.

623
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:33,147
We choose the true god
or the false.

624
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:45,630
Free folk,

625
00:48:45,664 --> 00:48:48,166
<i>there is only one true king

626
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,238
<i>and his name is Stannis.

627
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,638
Here stands your king of lies.

628
00:48:53,672 --> 00:48:56,943
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.
