00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,446
You're wearing a black cloak again.

2
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,201
I've been sent to negotiate with you.

3
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,800
It appears my trusting nature
got the better of me.

4
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,204
It's happened before.

5
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,887
I was hoping your loyalty was real
when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.

6
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,724
Truly, I was.

7
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,564
The Half hand ordered me to join your army

8
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,365
and bring back whatever information
I could to Castle Black.

9
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,920
He made me kill him so you'd trust me.

10
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,604
I was loyal

11
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,126
to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

12
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,005
All your vows?

13
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,002
She wasn't enough to turn you, eh?

14
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,049
Were you enough to turn her?

15
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,800
She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

16
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,530
Did you see her again at Castle Black?

17
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,087
Yes.

18
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,726
And?

19
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,881
She's dead.

20
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,201
Your doing?

21
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,170
No.

22
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,811
We'll drink to her.

23
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,690
Of all the ways I'd kill you,
poison would be the last.

24
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,401
- Ygritte.
- Ygritte.

25
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,966
That's not wine.

26
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,010
No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.

27
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,331
You did well. Fought hard.

28
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,166
Killed some of our strongest men.

29
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,802
One of our giants went into your tunnel
and never came out again.

30
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,325
Mag the Mighty.

31
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,370
He's dead.

32
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,604
He killed my friend Grenn.

33
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,011
MANCE: He was their king.

34
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,920
The last of a bloodline that stretches back
before the First Men.

35
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,443
Grenn came from a farm.

36
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,606
- Mag and Grenn.
- Grenn and Mag.

37
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,126
MANCE: Kullback, could I trouble you
for something to eat?

38
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,808
I don't imagine our guest has eaten
anything for quite some time.

39
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,121
So, you're here to strike a bargain?

40
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,928
Turn your army around and go home.

41
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,843
MANCE: You know I know
you're low on arrows,

42
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,327
you're low on oil, you're low on men.

43
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,209
How many are left, 50?

44
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,568
I told Tormund and Orell.

45
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,130
We have more than 1,000 men.

46
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,647
I showed you everything I had.
The whole army, 100,000 strong.

47
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,281
And what did you do?
You fired on us with everything you had.

48
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,441
It wasn't much.

49
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,003
As soon as I saw that,
I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,

50
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
an unmanned stretch five
miles west of here.

51
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,284
A lot of them will die climbing,

52
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,488
but most of them will be over
by the end of the day.

53
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,166
It's me being honest with you, Jon Snow,
which is more than you've ever done for me.

54
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,641
My people have bled enough.

55
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,846
We're not here to conquer.

56
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,090
We're here to hide behind your Wall.
Just like you.

57
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,564
We need your tunnel.

58
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,763
Now we both know that winter is coming.

59
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,128
And if my people aren't south of the Wall
when it comes in earnest,

60
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,043
we'll all end up worse than dead.

61
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,722
You want to strike a bargain with me?
Here's the bargain.

62
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,922
You go back, you open the gates to us,

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,288
and I swear to you that
no one else will die.

64
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,567
Refuse,

65
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,206
and we'll kill every last
man at Castle Black.

66
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,690
- (UNSHEATHING)
- Ah!

67
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,850
Oh...

68
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,490
That's why you're here.

69
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,570
I reckon you could do it
before any of them could stop you.

70
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,404
They'd kill you, of course.

71
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,686
They'd kill you slow.

72
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,481
But you knew that when you came in here.

73
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,761
Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?

74
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,287
Killing a man in his own tent
when he's just offered you peace?

75
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,203
Is that what the Night's Watch is?

76
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,241
Is that what you are?

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,246

You're the King-beyond-the-Wall?

95

- Do you know who I am?
- Never had the pleasure.

This is Stannis Baratheon,
the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.

97

We're not in the Seven Kingdoms,
and you're not dressed for this weather.

98
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,482
It is customary to kneel
when surrendering to a king.

99
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,044
We do not kneel.

100
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,003
I'll have thousands of your men
in chains by nightfall,

101

have nowhere to put them,
have nothing to feed them.

What's a man of the Night's Watch
doing in a wildling camp?

107
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,851
I was sent to discuss terms
with the King-beyond-the-Wall.

108
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,241
You're speaking to the one true king, boy.

109
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,129
You will address him as "Your Grace."

110
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,204
I know he's the king.
My father died for him.

111

I'm Ned Stark's son.

113

Your father was an honourable man.

114
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,363
He was, Your Grace.

115
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,323
What do you think he'd have done with him?

116
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,371
I was this man's prisoner once.

117
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,523
He could have tortured me.
He could have killed me.

118
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,682
But he spared my life.

119
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,967

have taken him prisoner,

If my father had seen the

he'd also tell you to

It is. The Death's Head manticore.

131
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,850
I've read a great deal about it.
It's a horrible poison.

- Usually Mantari in origin.

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,847
Saving him.

otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.

That's for the best.
No maester knows how to save him.

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,008
That is exactly the sort of arrogance

143
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,924
that had him expelled
from the Citadel, Your Grace.

144
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,289

dangerous and unnatural.

somewhat.

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,848
I will stay in King's Landing where
I belong with my son, the king.

178
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,606
When you were nine years old,
I was called to the capital.

179
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,921
I decided to take your brother with me
and not you.

180
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,207
You insisted that you would not be left
at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.

181
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,964
- If you recall...
- I'm not interested in hearing

182
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,647
another one of your smug stories
about the time you won.

183
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,961
This isn't going to be one of those times.

184
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,644
Do you think you'll be the first person

185
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,769
dragged into a Sept
to be married against her will?

186
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,649
When you marched into the throne room
to tell me

187
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,849
we'd won the Battle of Blackwater,
do you remember?

188
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,131
I was sitting on the
Iron Throne with Tommen.

189
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,165
I was about to give him
essence of nightshade.

190
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,685
That's how far I was willing to go

191
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,724
when I thought someone awful
had come to take my son away.

192
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,242
Someone awful is coming to take him away.

193
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,687
No.

194
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,809
Joffrey is dead.
Myrcella's been sold like livestock.

195
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,009
And now you want to ship me off
to Highgarden and steal my boy.

196
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,923
My last boy.

197
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,610
Margaery will dig her claws in,
you will dig your claws in,

198
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,241
and you'll fight over him like beasts
until you rip him apart.

199
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,370
I will burn our house to the ground
before I let that happen.

200
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,363
And how will you do that?

201
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,850
I'll tell everyone the truth.

202
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,281

203
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,166
You don't know, do you?

204
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,041
You never believed it.

205
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,807
How is that possible?

206
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,366
What am I saying? Of course it's possible.

207
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,848
How can someone so consumed
by the idea of his family

208
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,129
have any conception
what his actual family was doing?

209
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,244
We were right there in front of you,
and you didn't see us.

210
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,561
One real look in the past 20 years

211
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,325
at your own children
and you would have known.

212
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,890
Known what?

213
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,365
Everything they say is true

214
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,010
- about Jaime and me.
- No.

215
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,809
- Your legacy is a lie.
- No, no, no, no.

216

I don't believe you.

217
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,525
Yes, you do.

218
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,441
CERSEI: Jaime.

219
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,005
You won.

220
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,765
One fewer brother. Must
be proud of yourself.

221
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,127
There's really nothing
you wouldn't do, is there?

222
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,043
For my family, no, nothing.

223
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,168
I would do things for my family
you couldn't imagine.

224
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,811
- Tyrion is your family.
- He's not.

225
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,844
- You don't get to choose.
- I do. So do you.

226
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,924
You can choose the creature that killed
our mother to come into this world...

227
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,446
Are you really mad enough
to blame him for that?

228
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,166
He didn't decide to kill her.
He was an infant.

229
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,083
A disease doesn't decide to kill you.

230
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,845
All the same, you cut
it out before it does.

231

What do you decide?

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,487

- Those are words.
- Yes.

236
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,164
Like the ones I just said to Father.

237
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,205
I told him.

238
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,006
Told him what?

239
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,809
I told him about us.

240
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,007
- You told him?
- I told him I won't marry Loras Tyrell.

241
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,607
I told him I'm staying right here
with Tommen, with you.

242
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,485
- You think he'll just accept that?
- Go and ask him.

243
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,967
What did you say?

244
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,281
I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister.

245
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,968
I don't choose Tywin Lannister.

246

I don't love Tywin Lannister.
I love my brother.

My name is Fennesz.

I can speak the Common Tongue, if you wish.

263

You speak it very well.

264
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,960
Before you freed me,
I belonged to Master Mighdal.

265
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,204
I was tutor to his children.
I taught them languages and history.

266
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,242
They know a great deal about your family
because of me.

267

Little Calla is only seven,
but she admires you very much.

I hope I can prove worthy

What can I do for you?

270
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,682
When you took the city, the children
begged me not to leave the house.

271
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,889
But Master Mighdal and
I agreed that I must.

272
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,761
So I lost my home.

273
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,809
Now I live on the streets.

274
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,564
I have outfitted mess halls

275
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,041
to feed all former slaves
and barracks to shelter them.

276
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,407

Even if they are safe,
who would I be there?

What purpose would I serve?

284
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,809
With my master, I was a teacher.

285
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,521
I had the respect and love of his children.

I ask you to let me sell myself
back to Master Mighdal.

There are many outside

I took it to bring people freedom.

00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,643
I was watching you.
I thought you might need some help.

I cut down your butcher's boy. The ginger.

575
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,842

- Enough.

I can pay.

01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,563
There is nothing in the North
but ice and war and pirates.

01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,849
I wouldn't need a cabin. Please.

- The Free City of Braavos.

- It's not silver.
