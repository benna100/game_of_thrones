1
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,236
Valar morghulis.

2
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,572
Valar dohaeris.

3
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:32,578
I've been sweeping
this floor for days.

4
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,445
Good.

5
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,281
I didn't come here
to sweep floors.

6
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,417
No?

7
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,885
Why come, then?

8
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,621
You said I could be
your apprentice.

9
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,757
You said you'd teach me
how to be a Faceless Man.

10
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,527
A man teaches a girl.

11
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,663
Valar dohaeris.

12
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,765
All men must serve.

13
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,535
Faceless Men most of all.

14
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,772
I want to serve.

15
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,810
A girl wants to serve herself.

16
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,679
Here we serve
the Many-Faced God.

17
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,947
To serve well,

18
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,283
a girl must become no one.

19
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:12,751
Which one's the Many-Faced God?

20
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:17,289
I see the Stranger.
I see the Drowned God.

21
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,757
I see the weirwood face.

22
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,326
There is only one god.

23
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,595
A girl knows his name.

24
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,265
And all men know his gift.

25
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,837
Where are they taking him?

26
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,920
<i>- ( Bells tolling )
- ( people shouting )

27
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:27,826
( people shouting ) Queen Margaery!
Queen Margaery!

28
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,966
Man: <i>Queen Margaery!

29
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,937
Queen Margaery!

30
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,807
<i>Queen Margaery!

31

<i>- I am his and he is mine.
- I am hers and she is mine.

32
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:52,951
Both: <i>From this day until
the end of my days.

33
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,920
( breathing heavily )

34
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,929
Did I hurt you?

35
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,765
No. You were lovely.

36
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:43,168
- It all happened so fast.
- Yes. ( chuckles )

37
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,036
I was scared maybe I hurt you.

38
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,407
- It sounded like...
- No, no, no.

39
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,508
You're very sweet.

40
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,978
The sweetest king
who ever lived.

41
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,148
This is all I want
to do all day,

42
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,849
every day,
for the rest of my life.

43
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,553
( laughs ) Wouldn't
that be glorious?

44
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,522
Shouldn't we rest
a little while?

45
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,825
Just to catch our breath?
There's no rush, is there?

46
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,094
Of course not.

47
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:09,928
Are you hungry?

48
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,432
Should I have them bring you
some cake or pomegranate juice?

49
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,900
No, I'm fine.

50
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,736
I just want you all to myself.

51
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,138
I want to know everything
there is to know

52
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,942
about King Tommen,
First of His Name.

53
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,744
King Tommen.

54
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:28,447
Still sounds strange to me.

55
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,017
Does Queen Margaery
sound strange to you?

56
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,553
So strange.

57
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,721
- Husband.
- Wife.

58
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,890
( laughs )

59
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,127
Sometimes it feels odd.

60
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:42,994
I'm the king,

61
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:47,566
I've married the most
beautiful woman in the world,

62
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:51,102
and it's all because
my brother died.

63
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,637
I understand.

64
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,541
But it's not your fault.
You know that, don't you?

65
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,977
You mustn't feel guilty.

66
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,214
I don't feel guilty.

67
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,516
That's what's odd.

68
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,587
Do you like to sail?

69
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,689
I love to sail.

70
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,957
I do, too.

71
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,994
I think we're going to be
very happy, you and I.

72
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,597
I do, too.

73
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,565
( Kisses )

74
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:25,937
Living in a tower so high
it touches the clouds.

75
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,940
Of course, my grandmother
couldn't wait to go home.

76
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,844
The capital's not
for everyone, I suppose.

77
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,249
Does your mother like it here?

78
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,517
I don't think so.

79
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,254
She told me never to trust
anyone in King's Landing.

80
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,558
It's so wonderful to have
her watching over you.

81
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,227
A lioness guarding her cub.

82
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,597
Well, but I'm a man now.

83
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,135
You are.

84
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,038
And the king.

85
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,676
But you'll always be
her baby boy.

86
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,579
- I suppose.
- <i> I adore her.

87
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:11,983
She's always been so
generous with me, so kind.

88
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,552
And the horrors
she's had to endure...

89
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:17,656
Losing her husband, her
eldest child, and her father.

90
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,258
It's no wonder she's
so protective of you.

91
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,029
She'll never let you
out of her sight.

92
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,633
Cersei: You look
very much in love.

93
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,969
The first days of marriage
are often so blissful.

94
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:35,307
She's certainly
very pretty, isn't she?

95
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,708
Like a doll.

96
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,277
She smiles quite a lot.

97
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,847
Do you think she's intelligent?

98
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,317
I can't quite tell.

99
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,952
Not that it matters.

100
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,186
Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

101
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,222
There's nothing for me
in Casterly Rock.

102
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,992
That's where you grew up.

103
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,895
You always told me that you
liked the people there better.

104
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:01,333
You said that King's Landing smelled
of horse dung and sour milk.

105
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,835
( Chuckles )

106
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,004
Why are we speaking
of Casterly Rock?

107
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,940
The way that
you talked about it,

108
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,976
I always thought
that you missed it,

109
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,079
that you... that it
was your real home.

110
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:18,683
This is my real home now,
where my family lives.

111
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,886
I want you to be happy, Mother.

112
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,923
I know that.

113
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,324
I know you do.

114
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,225
My sweet boy.

115
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,695
But wouldn't you be
happier in Casterly Rock?

116
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:35,166
Margaery: <i>I said, "Darling,
surely four times is enough."

117
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,302
- <i> ( women giggling )</i> -<i> "Are you
trying to set a new record?"

118
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,973
He said, "Well, what is the record?
I'm sure we can break it."

119
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,309
( laughing )

120
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,080
Mother.

121
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,216
Welcome.

122
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,118
Don't you look lovely?

123
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,219
Marriage agrees with you.

124
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,988
Can we bring you
anything to eat or drink?

125
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,757
I wish we had some wine for you.

126
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,359
It's a bit early
in the day for us.

127
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,697
No, no, I can't stay.

128
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,099
I just wanted to let you know

129
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,935
if there's ever anything
I can do for you...

130
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,103
You are very sweet.

131
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,939
Tommen seems quite taken
with his new queen.

132
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,976
I absolutely adore him.

133
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,911
You raised a gallant young man.

134
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,813
I'm forever grateful.

135
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,248
Good.

136
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,351
Good. I'm glad to
hear you're happy.

137
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,753
Ecstatic. I really am.

138
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,121
Exhausted, to be honest.

139
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:34,793
But what could I expect?
He is half lion, half stag.

140
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,795
( Women laugh )

141
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,897
I'll leave you to it, then.

142
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,031
Oh, forgive me.

143
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,033
I haven't been
at court for long.

144
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,001
I get so confused.

145
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,336
What's the proper way
to address you now?

146
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:48,907
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

147
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,076
There's no need
for such formalities.

148
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,345
In any event, judging from
the king's enthusiasm,

149
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,348
the Queen Mother will be
a Queen Grandmother soon.

150
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,850
Won't that be a lovely day?

151
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,385
Can you imagine
the celebrations?

152
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,354
They'll ring the bells
all day and night.

153
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,724
Remember...

154
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,193
anything you need.

155

Ramsay:
<i>Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.

Said the Warden of the North
would always be a Stark

rise up against us.

00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,496
I had a pact
with Tywin Lannister.

181
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,098
And Tywin Lannister is dead.

182
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,869
The remaining Lannisters are a thousand
miles away dealing with that fact.

183
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,005
<i>They've never once in the
history of the Seven Kingdoms

184
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,540
sent their army this far north.

185
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,943
If you think they will
for us, you're a fool.

186
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,645
<i>We've become a great house

187
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,914
<i>by entering into alliances
with other houses

188
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,317
and parlaying those alliances
into greater power.

189
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,187
The best way to forge
a lasting alliance

190
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:52,190
isn't by peeling
a man's skin off.

191
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,425
The best way is marriage.

192
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,362
Now that you're a Bolton
by royal decree,

193
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:01,199
it's high time you married
a suitable bride.

194
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,303
And as it happens,

195
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:10,508
I've found the perfect girl to
solidify our hold on the North.

196
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,064
That's Moat Cailin.

197
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,567
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

198
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,536
You've been here before?

199
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,672
On our way down
to King's Landing

200
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,574
with my father and Arya.

201
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,610
Where are you taking me?

202
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,478
Home.

203
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,149
The Boltons have Winterfell.

204
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,221
Your marriage proposal,
it wasn't for you.

205
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,524
No.

206
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,961
Roose Bolton
murdered my brother.

207
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,029
He betrayed my family.

208
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,064
He did.

209
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,232
He serves the Lannisters.

210
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,133
For now.

211
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,103
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

212
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,571
- Not anymore.
- Always.

213
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,374
You're a Stark. Dying your
hair doesn't change that.

214
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:22,013
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving
child of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

215
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,448
<i>Your place is in the North.

216
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,650
I can't marry him.
You can't make me.

217
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,019
He is a traitor. A murderer!

218
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,654
You're not marrying
Roose Bolton.

219
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,757
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir Ramsay.

220
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,493
One day he'll be Warden
of the North and you...

221
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,327
- No.
- Sansa.

222
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,230
No, you can't make me.
I will starve myself.

223
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,466
I will die before
I have to go there.

224
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:44,369
I won't force you
to do anything.

225
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:48,072
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

226
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,174
Say the word and we turn
the horses around,

227
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,577
but listen to me. Listen.

228
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,413
You've been running
all your life.

229
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,149
Terrible things happen to
your family and you weep.

230
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,285
You sit alone in a darkened
room mourning their fates.

231
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:06,157
You've been a bystander to tragedy from
the day they executed your father.

232
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,360
Stop being a bystander.
Do you hear me?

233
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,295
Stop running.

234
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,236
There's no justice in the world.

235
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,105
Not unless we make it.

236
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,742
You loved your family.

237
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,279
Avenge them.

238
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,587
<i>( Horse neighs )

239
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,722
Man: <i>Banners!

240
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,841
How do we get through there?

241
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,375
We don't.

242
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,844
We go around.

243
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,379
Takes us miles out of the way.

244
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,848
We'll lose sight of them.

245
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,282
Brienne: Doesn't matter.

246
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,451
I know where they're going.

247
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,858
Aren't you getting
a bit old to be a squire?

248
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,663
How did you end up
squiring for the Imp?

249
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,132
He hates that nickname.

250
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,768
Well, he's not here
to complain about it, is he?

251
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,441
I squired for a knight
named Ser Lorimer

252
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,143
during the War
of the Five Kings.

253
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,146
One night he had
a bit too much to drink

254
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,349
and he was famished,
so he borrowed a ham.

255
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,817
He borrowed it?

256
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,618
He wasn't a thief.

257
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,320
He was drunk and hungry
and he wasn't thinking.

258
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,289
<i>I was drunk, too.

259
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,159
He gave me half the ham.

260
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,896
Next morning, one of the
guards saw him passed out

261
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:29,534
<i>under a wagon with the
hambone still in his hand.

262
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,403
They hanged him that afternoon.

263
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,771
They tied the noose for me, too,

264
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,475
<i>but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

265
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,442
so he pardoned me

266
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,946
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

267
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:45,183
As punishment for both of you.

268
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,384
It didn't seem that way.

269
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,352
Lord Tyrion was always
very good to me.

270
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,355
Yes, all your lords
have been very kind to you.

271
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,223
All except me.

272
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,659
Sorry you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

273
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,529
I'm not sorry. You're the
best fighter I've ever seen.

274
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,932
You beat the Hound.

275
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,801
I'm proud to be your squire.

276
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,740
I'm sorry I'm always
snapping at you.

277
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,411
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

278
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,217
You want to be a knight, Pod?

279
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:19,850
Yes.

280
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,587
<i>Starting tomorrow, we'll train
with a sword twice a day.

281
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:26,424
Before we ride in the morning and
after you make camp in the evening.

282
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,460
- And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.
- Thank you.

283
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,663
I can't knight you, but I
can teach you how to fight.

284
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,433
I suppose that's more important.

285
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:50,448
You weren't a knight,
but you were a Kingsguard

286
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,351
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

287
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,485
I was.

288
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,855
Lord Tyrion said
he was a good man.

289
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,492
He was.

290
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,595
How did you end up
serving Renly?

291
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,303
When I was a girl,
my father held a ball.

292
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:16,774
I'm his only living child, so he
wanted to make a good match for me.

293
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,909
He invited dozens
of young lords to Tarth.

294
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:23,314
I didn't want to go, but he
dragged me to the ballroom.

295
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,586
And it was wonderful.

296
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:33,924
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

297
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,460
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

298
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,864
when they thought
it was their turn to dance.

299
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,666
They whispered in my ear

300
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:46,837
how they wanted to marry me and
take me back to their castles.

301
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,909
My father smiled at me
and I smiled at him.

302
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,913
I had never been so happy.

303
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,786
Till I saw a few
of the boys snickering.

304
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:04,088
And then they all
started to laugh.

305
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,491
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

306
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,528
They were toying with me.

307
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,464
"Brienne the Beauty"
they called me.

308
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,399
Great joke.

309
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:20,037
And I realized I was
the ugliest girl alive.

310
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,808
A great lumbering beast.

311
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:28,846
I tried to run away,

312
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,949
but Renly Baratheon
took me in his arms.

313
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:35,586
"Don't let them see your
tears," he told me.

314
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:36,921
"They're nasty little shits

315
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:40,691
and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

316
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:45,096
He danced with me and none of the
other boys could say a word.

317
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,899
Renly was the king's
brother after all.

318
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,571
But wasn't he...?

319
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,441
Lord Tyrion said he was...

320
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:00,811
Yes, Pod, he liked men.
I'm not an idiot.

321
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,780
He didn't love me.
He didn't want me.

322
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,882
He danced with me
because he was kind

323
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,385
and didn't want to see me hurt.

324
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,454
He saved me from being a joke.

325
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:14,825
From that day
until his last day.

326
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,830
And I couldn't
save him in return.

327
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:26,904
Nothing's more hateful than failing
to protect the one you love.

328
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:31,142
One day I will avenge
King Renly.

329
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:34,545
But you said a shadow
murdered him.

330
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:35,479
How do you fight a shadow?

331
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:39,417
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

332
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,854
I know it was Stannis.
I know it in my heart.

333
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,126
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

334
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:53,864
And a man can be killed.

335
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:58,669
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

336
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,204
I'd like to speak alone.

337
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,540
Olly is my steward now

338
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,108
as I was
Lord Commander Mormont's.

339
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:10,648
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

340
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:14,118
One day he might command.

341
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,556
Very well.

342
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,158
Have you considered my offer?

343
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:22,927
I have.

344
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,896
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

345
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,966
All my life I wanted
to be Jon Stark.

346
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,502
Say the word and you will be.

347
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:35,072
But I have to refuse you.

348
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,676
I'm Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

349
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:39,944
My place is here.

350
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:43,581
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

351
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:47,117
to take back the castle
where you grew up.

352
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,754
To rule the North.

353
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,257
I wish I could fight beside you.

354
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,959
Believe me, I do.

355
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:58,028
But I swore a sacred vow
at the godswood.

356
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,565
I pledged my life
to the Night's Watch.

357
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:04,835
You're as stubborn
as your father.

358
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,070
And as honorable.

359
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,005
I can imagine no higher praise.

360
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,707
I didn't mean it as praise.

361
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,809
Honor got your father killed.

362
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,711
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

363
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:17,982
May I ask, Your Grace, how long
you plan to stay at Castle Black?

364
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:20,618
Are you bored of us already?

365
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,287
You saved us
from Mance Rayder's army.

366
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,522
We will never forget that.

367
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,624
But it's a question of survival.

368
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,260
<i>The Night's Watch can't
continue to feed your men

369
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:32,997

prisoners indefinitely.

370
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,132
Winter is coming.

371
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,134
I know it.

372
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,703
We march on Winterfell
within the fortnight,

373
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,640
before the snows trap us here.

374
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,008
And the wildlings?

375
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,911
If they'd rather burn than
fight for me, so be it.

376
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,712
I leave their fate to you.

377
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,883
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

378
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,855
Or you could see
if this Tormund fellow

379
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:00,791
is more willing to compromise
than Mance ever was.

380
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,226
I assume the brothers
of the Night's Watch

381
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,828
would rather see
the wildlings dead.

382
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,097
Most of the brothers, yes.

383
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,767

Have you considered sending
Alliser Thorne elsewhere?

Give him command
of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

389

The king is a complicated man,

but he wants to do what's
right for the Seven Kingdoms.

398

As long as he's ruling them.

399

He's the one true king.

400

He has a blood right
to that throne.

401

I've sworn to stay clear of the
politics of the Seven Kingdoms.

How does the Night's
Watch vow go again?

I'll bet you've got it
memorized since you got here.

Night gathers

406
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,942
No, not that bit.
The bit at the end.

407
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:27,778
I am the sword in the darkness,

408
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,146
the watcher on the walls,

409
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,181

the realms of men.

410
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,817
- <i> I pledge my life...</i>
- Right, that's enough.

411
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,987
The shield that guards
the realms of men.

412
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,255
That's what you swore to be.

413

Now, I'm not a learned man,

414
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:42,426
but the best way to help the
most people might not be sitting

415
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,828
in a frozen castle
at the edge of the world.

416
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,297
It just might mean
wading in the muck,

417
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,932
getting your boots dirty

418
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,035
and doing what needs to be done.

419
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:52,202
And what needs to be done?

420

As long as the Boltons
rule the North,

421
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,141

you're still in the Vale.

702
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:09,338
A message for me, you say?

703
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,639
Strange that the seal is broken.

704
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:13,042
I'm sure you understand
my position, Lord Baelish.

705
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:16,245
If you receive word in the
night from the Queen Mother,

706
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:18,614
it does make me question
our new alliance.

707
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:23,085
The Lannisters made you one of
the great lords of Westeros,

708
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:26,455
yet here you are in the
North undermining them.

709
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:29,091
Why gamble with your position?

710
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,394
Every ambitious move
is a gamble.

711
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:36,432
You gambled when you drove a
dagger into Robb Stark's heart.

712
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:40,202
It appears that
your gamble paid off.

713
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,737
You're Warden of the North.

714
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,806
I had Tywin Lannister's backing.

715
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:46,575
Who supports me now? You?

716
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:48,577
The Eyrie is mine.

717
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,679
The last time
the lords of the Eyrie

718
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,648
formed an alliance
with the lords of the North,

719
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:57,386
they brought down the greatest
dynasty this world has ever known.

720
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:02,591
I'd like to borrow
one of your birds.

721
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:04,760
Cersei will expect a reply.

722
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:07,797
I'd like to read the reply.

723
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,754
I have to get out
of this wheelhouse.

724
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,089
Volantis is a large city.

725
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:34,523
I have to get out
of this wheelhouse.

726
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:38,627
The likelihood of you being spotted
here increases a hundredfold.

727
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,262
Mm, I have to get out
of this wheelhouse.

728
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:44,800
( Sighs ) I'm not sure how many new
ways I can find of saying this.

729
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:51,574
I will not be of any use
to Daenerys Targaryen

730
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:52,741
if I lose my mind.

731
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:56,712
I can't remember the last
face I saw that wasn't yours.

732
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:58,647
It's a perfectly good face.

733
00:51:58,649 --> 00:51:59,849
I am losing my mind.

734
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:02,418
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll lose more than that.

735
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,388
Look, we are thousands
of miles from Westeros.

736
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:10,826
What am I?

737
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:12,862
One more drunk dwarf.

738
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:13,762
( Knocks )

739
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:17,199
- Driver: <i>Whoa!
- ( horses neigh )

740
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:20,769
( seagull screeching )

741
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:42,391
( people shouting )

742
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:43,626
Woman: <i>We have to go now.

743
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:45,828
<i>Come on, hold it. Hold it.

744
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,830
<i>Are you ready?

745
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:50,466
Slaves.

746
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:55,437
Yes, the Volantene masters
are very organized.

747
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,474
<i>Flies for dung shovelers.

748
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,843
<i>Hammers for builders.

749
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,412
<i>Tears for whores.

750
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,281
Lest they forget.

751
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:08,350
<i>( Woman speaking Valyrian )

752
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:16,926
( crowd repeating )

753
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,463
We should keep moving.

754
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:26,802
( Crowd repeating )

755
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:38,380
The only red priest
we had in King's Landing

756
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,216
was Thoros of Myr.

757
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:42,451
This one's much better-looking.

758
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:50,459
Stone Men.

759
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:53,963
Good luck stopping the spread
of greyscale with prayer.

760
00:53:53,965 --> 00:53:57,666
You'd have better luck
dancing away the plague.

761
00:53:57,668 --> 00:53:59,235
Shh.

762
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:09,345
We're going to meet the savior.

763
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:10,479
You should have told me.

764
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:13,983
<i>Who doesn't want
to meet the savior?

765
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:30,899
Come on.

766
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:33,435
Let's find a brothel.

767
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:39,275
- ( People shouting )
- ( animals calling )

768
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:42,478
Man: <i>Build your house in a day.

769
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,025
( speaking Valyrian )

770
00:54:56,027 --> 00:55:00,429
It's even better luck
to suck a dwarf's cock.

771
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:06,735
See? We blend right in.

772
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:10,906
Just two more travelers
mad with lust.

773
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:16,745
Thank you.

774
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,881
( Sniffing )

775
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,057
What curious hair.

776
00:55:29,393 --> 00:55:31,627
The Mother of Dragons!

777
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:33,329
<i>( Men laugh )

778
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:36,865
It appears you're not
the only Targaryen supporter.

779
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:37,867
( Man laughs )

780
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:40,035
We were just heading
east to see you.

781
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:41,570
I've got a dragon for you.

782
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:44,640
How much to make him spit fire?

783
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:50,579
Someone who inspires
priests and whores

784
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:51,914
is worth taking seriously.

785
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,449
What makes you worth that much?

786
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:56,485
- I'm magic.
- I'll bet you bloody are.

787
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:59,388
( laughing )

788
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:02,124
Well, she's taken.

789
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,126
Where are you going?

790
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:07,796
I need to speak
to someone with hair.

791
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:10,833
- Hello.
- Hello.

792
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:13,635
- You've got no drink.
- You've got no money.

793
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:16,805
Do I look like
a man without money?

794
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,674
Never trust looks.

795
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:23,011
Until quite recently, I was one
of the richest men in the world.

796
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,079
( laughs )

797
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:28,550
Who needs wealth when you
can make a woman laugh?

798
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:32,554
I always pay my debts.

799
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,456
I'm well known for it.

800
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:41,463
You like her.

801
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:42,931
They all like her.

802
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:44,032
They all want to fuck a queen.

803
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,502
That's because
they've never met a queen.

804
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:47,703
You're just saying that.

805
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:50,038
You know how to spot a liar.

806
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,908
If I could pick any girl here,

807
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,778
I would pick you.

808
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,678
Why?

809
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,782
Because you have
a skeptical mind.

810
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:05,487
All right, then.
I'm warning you,

811
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:08,624
we're going to have
to wash you first.

812
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:10,125
Come on.

813
00:57:17,168 --> 00:57:20,803
I'm... I'm sorry, I can't.

814
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:24,706
Of course you can. You're shy.

815
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,842
I'm not.

816
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:29,445
Have another drink.

817
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,847
Gladly, but this I can't do.

818
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:35,584
Believe me, no one is
more shocked than I am.

819
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:37,886
I hope it passes.

820
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:41,056
What will I do in my spare time?

821
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:46,829
Go for a piss. That's a start.

822
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,882
No need to worry. I was just...

823
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:11,253
Oh, I thought
you were someone else.

824
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:12,588
Show's almost over.

825
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:17,526
I'm sure there are girls inside
who'd be happy to oblige.

826
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:18,994
You've made
some kind of mistake.

827
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:23,031
Why don't you tell me what you
think you're doing and then...

828
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:26,835
I'm taking you to the queen.
