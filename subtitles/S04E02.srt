MYRANDA: I can't see her. Tansy!

Run, Tansy!

Good girls. Down.

13
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,208
Well done. You, too.

14
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,090
- I only wounded her.
- You brought her down. That's what matters.

15
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,881
A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?

16
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,486
- A fine shot, master. My lady.
- TANSY: Please, my lord.

17
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,922
- (SOBBING) It hurts. Please.
- Sweet. Don't cry.

18
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,085
It will be over soon.

19
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,368
She thinks she's pretty.

20
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,646
Let me put one through her face.

RAMSAY: We have to
reward the hounds, love.

22
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,605
- They did all the hard work.
- Why? I did whatever you asked.

23
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,603
RAMSAY: But you made Myranda feel jealous.

24
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,763
- Me, jealous of her?
- My lord, please.

25
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,645
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

26
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,928
Rip her!

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,684
- Rip her!
- (TANSY SCREAMING)

28
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,727
Not so pretty now.

29
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,251
TYRION: Your new hand,
it's nicer than the old one.

30
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,567
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

31
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,006
- Is it solid gold?
- Gilded steel.

32
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,042
You're not eating. Why is no one eating?

33
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,521
My wife wastes away
and my brother starves himself.

34
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,491
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand, not a stomach.

35
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,441
Try the boar.

36
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,127
Cersei can't get enough of it
since one killed Robert for her.

37
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,925
A toast.

38
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,446
To the proud Lannister children.

39
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,608
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

40
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,846
- I'll clean it up.
- No, I'll do it. Leave us.

41
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,923
It's only wine.

(DOOR CLOSES)

43
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,085
I can't fight any more.

44
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,721
What about your left?

45
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,082
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts are wrong.

46
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,604
How can I protect the King
when I can hardly wipe my own ass?

47
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,131
You're the Lord Commander now.

48
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,451
Command. Let others do the fighting.

49
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,444
When was the last time Father used a sword?

50
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,608
I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer.

51
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,127
When people find out I
can't slay a pigeon...

52
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,247
Train, then.

53
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,881
- Learn to fight with your other hand.
- With whom? You?

54
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,606
Men talk.

55
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,002
As soon as someone discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

56
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,726
You need a proper, discreet swordsman.

57
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,642
I have just the one.

58
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,931
My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,401
Unusual talent for a sellsword.

60
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,121
He tells me you shit gold,
just like your father.

61
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,164
Is this place safe?

62
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,241
There's this knight, Leygood.
Got thunderbolts on his shield.

63
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,361
Uh-huh.

64
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,240
Right here is where I fuck his wife.

65
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,562
She's a screamer, that one.

66
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,802
If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.

67
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,247
(WHISTLES) I've never seen Valyrian steel
before. She's a beauty.

68
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,250
Problem is,

69
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,210
if you fight with an edged
blade, I'll have to.

70
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,882
And if I fight with an edged blade,

71
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,803
I'll have no one left to pay me.

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,051
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when his guard's down.

77
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,121
Best time to attack a man.

78
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,164
Mind yourself.

79
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,807
- If I still had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

Hello.

90

watered, and rubbed down.

91
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,120
And take Lady Walda to her chambers.

92

93
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,969
Where is your prize?

94

With the hounds.

95
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,609
I'll have a look at him.

96
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,127
I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.

97
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,044
Word travels. How he screamed.

98
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,122
- You would have loved it.

(THEON GRUNTS)

101
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,930
What did you do to him?

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,206
I trained him.

103
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,045
He was a slow learner, but he learned.

104
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,045
- You flayed him.
- Peeled a few bits.

105
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,844
Removed a few others.

106
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,081
This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.

107
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,084
We've been flaying our enemies
for 1,000 years.

108

The flayed man is on our banners.

109
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,683
My banners, not yours.

110
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,330
You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow.

111
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,761
Tywin Lannister has given me the North.

112
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,207
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

113
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,964
As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin,

114
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,283
our armies are trapped south of the Neck.

115
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,730
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

116
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,166
I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.

117
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,010
I already asked.

118
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,487
Lord Greyjoy refused.

119
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,681
Savages have no...

120
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,650
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

121
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,688
You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort.

122
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,961
I acted.

123
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,882
I had to smuggle myself into my own lands,
thanks to the Greyjoys.

124
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,407
I needed Theon whole.

125
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,282
Theon was our enemy.

126
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,361
But Reek

127
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,842
will never betray us.

128
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,521
I placed far too much trust in you.

129
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,441
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

130
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,844
- It's disrespectful.
- Sorry, my lord.

Give him the razor.

I'm not a Bolton, Father.
What does it matter?

133
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,045
Go on, Reek.

134
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,441
A nice close shave.

135
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,807
Reek,

136
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,645
tell Father,

137
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,601
where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

138
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,281
I don't know, my lord.

139
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,126
You murdered them

140
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,290

did you murder the Stark boys?

No, my lord.

144
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,206
Just two farm boys.

145
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,963
RAMSAY: And crisped them
so no one would know?

146
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,883
THEON: Yes, my lord.

147
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,088
The Starks have always ruled the North.

148
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,208
If Bran and Rickon are alive,

149
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,647
the country will rally to their side,

150
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,241
now that Robb Stark is gone.

151
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,290
Oh, that's right, Reek.

152
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,330
Robb Stark is dead.

153
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,886
Sorry.

154
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,404
I know he was like a brother to you.

155
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,207
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

156

- Always.

Find those boys and I'll give
you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.

160

Your pet rat have any thoughts
on which way they went after Winterfell?

161
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,330
Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

162
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,843
Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

163
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,809
Their bastard brother.

164
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,644
He could be sheltering them.

165
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,960
He may know where they are.

166
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,646
Even if he doesn't, he's
half Stark himself.

167
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,767
Could be a threat.

You want to prove yourself a Bolton?

169
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,731
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for Moat Cailin.

170
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,766
Bring this creature of yours.

171
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,242
Maybe he'll be of some use.

172
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,403
Take the Moat for the
family, for our family,

173
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,041
and I'll reconsider your position.

Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the King?

175
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,888
I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome
at such exclusive affairs.

176
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,047
Oh, to be foreign.

She already told your sister.

It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

180
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,531
So I'm guilty of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

181
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,047
My father will ask you if there's anything
more, and you'll tell him some clever lie.

No, I will not.

How long do you imagine
your father and sister would let me live

if they suspected me of lying?

185
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,846
I have no pet sellsword to protect me.

No legendary brother to avenge me.

Only little birds who whisper in my ear.

Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

She won't leave.

I've told her this is a dangerous place
so many times, she no longer believes it.

193

Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

May you and my daughter Margaery
drink deep and live long.

You've been gone for hours.

you'll forget what it was to be human.

You'd forget us, Bran.

- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

509
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,290
You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.

00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,409
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

Brought shame on the Citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

I never meant to annoy anyone.

But you are. You're annoying me right now.

518
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,727
Every breath you draw in my presence
annoys me.

519
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,610
So here's what I want you to do.
Leave my presence.

will be brought to the kennels.

00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,602
Your Grace, Queen Margaery...

524
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,766
The Queen is telling you
the leftovers will feed the dogs,

525
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,370
or you will.

526
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,405
A gold dragon to
whoever knocks my fool's hat off.

527
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,370
(CROWD LAUGHING)

528
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,407
TYWIN: You're in rather a good mood.

529
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,884
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

530
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,804
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

531
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,245
Prince Oberyn.

532
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,731
I don't believe you have met Ellaria.

533
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,564
This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister,

534
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,086
and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent.

535
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,731
I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.

536
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,163
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,

537
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,082
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

538
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,043
Charmed.

539
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,963
Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.

540
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,885
We are everywhere in Dorne.
I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.

541
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,361
Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?

542
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,841
- We don't despise them in Dorne.
- No? How tolerant of you.

543
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,801
I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei,
giving up your regal responsibilities.

544
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,970
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

545
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,281
I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.

546
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,041
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

547
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,528
Please give him our regards.

548
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,843
With any luck, the gout will abate with
time and he will be able to walk again.

549
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,888
They call it the rich man's disease.

550
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,166
A wonder you don't have it.

551
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,890
Noblemen in my part of the country

552
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,248
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

553
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,084
People everywhere have their differences.

554
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,527
In some places,
the highborn frown upon those of low birth.

555
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,528
In other places,
the rape and murder of women and children

556
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,409
is considered distasteful.

557
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,846
What a fortunate thing for you,
former Queen Regent,

558
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,885
that your daughter Myrcella has been sent
to live in the latter sort of place.

(GOBLET CLINKING)

560
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,202
Everyone, silence! Clear the floor.

561
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,531
There's been too much amusement
here today.

562
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,447
A royal wedding is not an amusement.

563
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,851
A royal wedding is history.

564
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,209
Time has come for all of us
to contemplate our history.

565
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,601
My lords,

566
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,964
my ladies,

567
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,725
I give you

- King Joffrey,

Renly, Stannis,

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,206
Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy!

571
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,164
The War of the Five Kings!

(CROWD CHEERING)

573
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,562
I'm the rightful king.

574
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,247
- King in the North!
- Yes!

575
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,491
ACTOR 1: Traitor.

576
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,608
- ACTOR 2: You're a traitor.
- (LAUGHING)

577
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,921
ACTOR 3: I'm the King
of the Seven Kingdoms!

578
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,089
Let the war begin.

Renly, you're no king.

Away, degenerate.

582
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,051
- Careful.
- (SQUEALS)

583
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,327
- Go on.
- I want you to be my prince.

Who's got the gold now, Stark?

587
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,125
I am the rightful king.

588
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,089
Challenge me, kraken.

589
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,730
- Take that.
- I'm drowning!

PODRICK: Yes, my lord.

595
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,729
We'll have to find another way
to thank the King.

Here you are. Champion's purse.

Though you're not the
champion yet, are you?

A true champion defeats
all the challengers.

Surely there are others out there
who still dare to challenge my reign.

How about you?
I'm sure they have a spare costume.

One taste of combat was enough for me,
Your Grace.

I would like to keep
what remains of my face.

I think you should fight him.

616

This was but a poor imitation
of your own bravery on the field of battle.

I speak as a firsthand witness.

Climb down from the high table
with your new Valyrian sword

619
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,168
and show everyone
how a true king wins his throne.

620
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,485
Be careful, though.

621
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,724
This one is clearly mad with lust.

622
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,562
It would be a tragedy for
the King to lose his virtue

It did not spill.

to toast without wine?

Uncle, you can be my cupbearer

633
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,289
seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.

Your Grace does me a great honour.

635
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,926
It's not meant as an honour.

636
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,800
Bring me my goblet.

637
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,281
What good is an empty cup?

638
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,321

these wet clothes, Your Grace.

No, you're perfect the way you are.
