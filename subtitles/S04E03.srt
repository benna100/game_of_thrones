1
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,290
You did this!

2
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,364
- We have to leave.
- CERSEI: Take him!

3
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,970
Where is his wife?

4
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,767
Where's Sansa?

5
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,323
Find her. Bar the gates of the city.
Seize every ship in the harbour.

6
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,609
- Where is she?
- No one leaves the capital!

7
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,845
Get in.

8
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,331
- Where are we going?
- Somewhere safe.

9
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,643
Up you go, my lady.

10
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,965
You'll be fine.

11
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,327
You're stronger than you know.

12
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,529
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

13
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,691
Are you hurt, my lady?

14
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,691
Good.

15
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,487
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

16
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,050
- The worst is past.
- DONTOS: Lord Baelish.

17
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,011
- I promised I'd get her to you safely.
- Softly, my friend.

18
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,927
Voices carry over water.

19
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,765
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

20
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,968
First you'll want your pay.

21
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,203
- Ten thousand, was it?
- Ten thousand.

22
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,641
Wait!

23
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,724
LITTLEFINGER: Shh.

24
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,888
You don't want the Queen to hear, do you?

25
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,930
A thousand gold cloaks
are searching for you.

26
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,002
And if they found you,

27
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,163
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the King?

28
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,129
I didn't murder anyone.

29
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,851
I know. But you must admit,
it looks suspicious.

30
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,922
The King who executed your father,

31
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,162
who tormented you for years,

32
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,766
and you fled the scene of his murder.

33
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,085
Why did you kill him?

34
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,801
Because he was a drunk and a fool,

35
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,724
and I don't trust drunk fools.

36
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,006
He saved me.

37
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,165
Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders.
Every one of them.

38
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,530
And he did it all for gold.

39
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,080
Money buys a man's silence for a time.

40
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,609
A bolt in the heart buys it forever.

41
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,731
He was helping me because I saved his life.

42
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,725
Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace

43
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,930
that once belonged to his grandmother.

44
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,811
The last legacy of House Hollard.

45
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,602
I had it made a few weeks ago.

46
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,084
What did I once tell you about the capital?

47
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,723
"We're all liars here."

48
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,489
Come, my lady.

49
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,801
I know you've had a difficult day.

50
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,522
But you're safe now.

51
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,728
I promise you that.

52
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,565
You're safe with me,

53
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,086
sailing home.

54
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,927
So am I the queen?

55
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,964
More than you were with Renly.

56
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,326
Less than you would have been

57
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,962
if Joffrey had done you the courtesy
of consummating the marriage before dying.

58
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,929
This would not be
an opportune moment to press the issue.

59
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,768
Clawing at his own throat,
looking to his mother to make it stop...

60
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,921
It was horrible.

61
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,321
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

62
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,004
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

63
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,403
They brought me your grandfather's body
when he died.

64
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,209
Made me look at it.

65
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,765
What was it like?

66
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,969
They took me to the Great Hall.
There he was.

67
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,691
The man I'd married
and suffered to father my children.

68
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,889
A great doughy lump I'd sat next to
at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.

69
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,526
There he was,

70
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,009
lying on a table.

71
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,127
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

72
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,123
and was stabbed through the heart.

73
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,362
Another was happiest torturing animals

74
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,807
and was poisoned at our wedding feast.

75
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,570
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

76
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,485
Your circumstances have improved markedly.

77
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,245
You may not have enjoyed watching him die,

78
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,129
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

79
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,168
being married to him, I
can promise you that.

80
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,282
But I would have been the queen.

81
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,408
Our alliance with the Lannisters

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,927
remains every bit as necessary to them
as it is unpleasant for us.

83
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,326
You did wonderful work on Joffrey.

84
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,728
The next one should be easier.

85
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,930
TYWIN: Your brother is dead.

86
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,002
Do you know what that means?

87
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,401
I'm not trying to trick you.

88
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,289
It means I'll become king.

89
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,569
Yes, you will become king.

90
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,847
What kind of king do you think you'll be?

91
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,362
- A good king?
- TYWIN: Mmm.

92
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,483
I think so as well.

93
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,690
You've got the right temperament for it.

94
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,160
But what makes a good king? Hmm?

95
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,043
What is a good king's
single most important quality?

96
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,088
This is hardly the place or the time.

97
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,122
- Holiness?
- Hmm.

98
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,647
Baelor the Blessed was holy.

99
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,889
And pious.

100
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,644
He built this Sept.

101
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,763
He also named a 6-year-old boy High Septon

102
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,969
because he thought
the boy could work miracles.

103
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,131
He ended up
fasting himself into an early grave

104
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,489
because food was of this world
and this world was sinful.

105
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,607
Hmm.

106
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,283
- Justice.
- Mmm.

107
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,482
A good king must be just.

108
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,490
Orys I was just.

109
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
Everyone applauded his reforms,

110
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,122
nobles and commoners alike.

111
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,362
But he wasn't just for long.

112
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,647
He was murdered in his sleep
after less than a year by his own brother.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,889
Was that truly just of him?

114
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,443
To abandon his subjects to an evil that
he was too gullible to recognise?

115
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,808
- No.
- No.

116
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,965
- What about strength?
- Yes.

117
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,281
Strength.

118
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,125
King Robert was strong.

119
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,288
He won the rebellion

120
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,170
and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.

121
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,603
And he attended three Small Council
meetings in 17 years.

122
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,004
He spent his time whoring and hunting
and drinking

123
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,367
until the last two killed him.

124
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,043
So, we have a man
who starves himself to death,

125
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,649
a man who lets his own brother murder him,

126
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,167
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

127
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,128
What do they all lack?

128
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,530
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

129
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,286
- Wisdom is what makes a good king.
- Yes.

130
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,251
But what is wisdom? Hmm?

131
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,764
A house with great wealth and fertile lands
asks you for your protection

132
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,165
against another house with a strong navy
that could one day oppose you.

133
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,645
How do you know
which choice is wise and which isn't?

134
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,647
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

135
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,371
or shipyards and soldiers?

136
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,886
- No.
- TYWIN: Of course not.

137
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,289
A wise king knows what he knows
and what he doesn't.

138
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,127
You're young.

139
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,887
A wise young king listens to his counsellors
and heeds their advice until he comes of age.

140
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,203
And the wisest kings

141
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,329
continue to listen to them long afterwards.

142
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,765
Your brother was not a wise king.

143
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,328
Your brother was not a good king.

144
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,448
If he had been,

145
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,126
perhaps he'd still be alive.

146
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,170
Now, as the king, you will have to marry.

147
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,645
Do you understand why?

148
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,285
TOMMEN: A king needs a queen.

149
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,203
TYWIN: Yes, but why?

150
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,965
To further the family line.

151
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,208
- Do you know how that happens?
- TOMMEN: Yes.

152
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,966
TYWIN: But has anyone
explained the details to you?

153
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,610
TOMMEN: I don't think so.

154
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,445
It's all relatively straightforward.

155
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,651
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

156
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,529
You are. You will be.

157
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,609
I'll see to that.

158
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,122
Please give the Queen
a moment alone with her son.

159
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,521
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

160
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,565
(SNAPS FINGERS)

161
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,600
(SOBS)

162
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,528
It was Tyrion.

163
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,651
He killed him.

164
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,648
He told me he would.

165
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,170
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy,

166
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,801
"and your joy will turn to ashes
in your mouth."

167
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,601
That's what he said to me.

168
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,604
You saw it.

169
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,083
- You saw Joff point at him just before he...
- I don't know what I saw.

170
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,041
Avenge him.

171
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,041
Avenge our son.

172
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,641
Kill Tyrion.

173
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,569
Tyrion's my brother.

174
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,244
Our brother.

175
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,007
There'll be a trial.
We'll get to the truth of what happened.

176
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,526
I don't want a trial.

177
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,922
He'll squirm his way to freedom
given the chance.

178
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,605

00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,290
Of course I blame you.

527
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,324
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

528
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,561
Should I be concerned?

529
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,087
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

530
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,685
I am a man of reason.

531
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,408
If I cut your throat today,
I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.

532
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,246
Men at war commit all kinds of crimes
without their superiors' knowledge.

533
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,800
So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?

534
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,604
Categorically.

535
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,041
I would like to speak with the Mountain.

536
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,601
I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.

537
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,604
He might not enjoy it
as much as he thinks he would.

538
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,530
I could arrange for this meeting.

539
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,402
But you want something in return.

540
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,090
There will be a trial for my son
and, as custom dictates,

541
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,970
three judges will render a verdict.

542
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,451
I will preside.

543
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,649
Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.

544
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,849
I would like you to be the third.

545
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,765
Why?

546
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,640
Not long ago,
the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon.

547
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,405
Declared themselves enemies of the throne.

548
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,562
Now they are our strongest allies.

549
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,120
Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.

550
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,449
Asking me to judge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

551
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,362
I would also invite you
to sit on the Small Council

552
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,922
to serve as one of
the new king's principal advisors.

553
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,448
I never realised
you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

554
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,206
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

555
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,922
The King is dead.
The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.

556
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,045
A wildling army marches on the Wall.

557
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,409
And in the east,
a Targaryen girl has three dragons.

558
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,764
Before long,
she will turn her eyes to Westeros.

559
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,485
Only the Dornish managed to resist
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

560
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,203
You're saying you need us?

561
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,441
That must be hard for you to admit.

562
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,568
We need each other.

563
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,204
You help me serve justice to
the King's assassins,

564
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,045
and I will help you serve
justice to Elia's.

Apologies for the stench.

I brought you some wine, my lord,
but they took it from me.

569

A noble effort.

570
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,247
They didn't find the candles, though.

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,764

I've heard nothing, my lord.

577
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,769
I suppose that's a good thing.

578
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,643
What are they saying about me out there?

- No, my lord.

You didn't?

00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,441
Gods, no.

583
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,765
The world is a better place without him,
but I had nothing to do with it.

584
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,566
I would like to think
if I were arranging a royal assassination,

585
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,688
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there,

I'm supposed to get a list

Anyone who might testify on your behalf.

Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

599
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,650
How generous of them.

600
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,529
Very well, my wife. Sansa.

601
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,489
My lord, she's gone.

602
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,690
- Gone?
- No one's seen her since the wedding.

You don't think she...

604
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,168
No one had more cause to kill Joffrey
than Sansa,

605
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,242
but the girl is no assassin.

606
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,449
Whoever killed the King
wanted me to lose my head for it.

607
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,002
And with my wife's disappearance,
it makes me seem that much more guilty.

Or woman. My father.

612
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,931
Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.

Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

Whenever something bad happens to me, I
assume it's my sister that had a hand in it.

But say what you will of Cersei,

616
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,210
she loves her children.

She is the only one I'm certain
had nothing to do with this murder.

618

Which makes it unique
as King's Landing murders go.

Varys could vouch for me, if he dared.

621

as a witness for the Queen.

Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

They won't let him see you.

Why not?

625
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,411
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

626
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,005
He's under investigation himself.

00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,323
And my brother?
Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?

A man, I didn't know his face,

631
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,603
he came to ask if I'd testify against you.

632
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,171
Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne

633
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,602
if I told the judges
you'd bought a poison called the strangler.

634
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,968
Ser Podrick Payne?

635
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,125
- Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
- I didn't tell them anything, my lord.

636
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,524
Are you going to accept their offer?

637
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,530
- My lord.
- Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.

638
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,888
If they can't tempt you with honey,
they'll choose something less sweet.

- You've been good to me, my lord.
- Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.

00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,444
They'll want an answer before that.

641
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,806
I already gave them an answer, my lord.

642
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,890

00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,882
That is our job.

698
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,770
(HORN BLOWS)

699
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,845
Rangers returning.

700
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,489
MAN: Help him.

701
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,010
Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.

702
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,051
ALLISER: What took you so long?

703
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,607
- We were held up.
- By what?

704
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,121
Chains.

705
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,807
We were guests of the mutineers
at Craster's Keep.

706
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,531
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

707
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,723
They've got Craster's food and his wives.

708
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,361
DOLOROUS EDD: Poor girls.
Never thought they'd miss their daddy.

709
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,084
Karl's running things now.

710
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,640
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

711
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,324
We need to ride north and kill them all.

712
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,970
We just went over this, boy.

713
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,520
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

714
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,128
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

715
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,527
Karl and the others know the truth
as well as we do.

716
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,487
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

717
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,564
when the wildlings are
peeling their fingernails off?

718
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,683
Mance has all he needs to crush us,
he just doesn't know it yet.

719
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,326
As soon as he gets his hands on them,
he will.

720
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,769
Then he'll throw his full strength at us.

721
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,210
And even if every one of us
kills 100 wildlings,

722
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,886
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

723
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,481
I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.

724
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,608
DAENERYS: Are they attacking?

725
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,208
JORAH: A single rider.

726
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,651
A champion of Meereen.

727
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,724
They want you to send your own champion
against him.

728
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,489
What is he doing?

729
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,291
I believe he means to...

730
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,882
He says that
we're an army of men without man parts.

731
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,601
He claims you are no woman at all,
but a man who

732
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,048
hides his cock in his own arsehole.

733
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,086
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

734
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,449
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

735
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,443
(MAN CONTINUES SPEAKING VALYRIAN)

736
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,650
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

737
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,684
First, I will need this one to be quiet.

738
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,841
Do I have a champion?

739
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,364
Allow me this honour, Mother of Dragons.

740
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,802
I will not disappoint you.

741
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,765
You are the commander of the Unsullied.

742
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,805
I cannot risk you.

743
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,648
Your Grace, I've won more single combats
than any man alive.

744
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,927
Which is why you must remain by my side.

745
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,928
I've been by your side
longer than any of them, Khaleesi.

746
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,604
Let me stand for you today as well.

747
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,569
You are my most trusted advisor,

748
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,530
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

749
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,329
I will not gamble with your life.

750
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,921
DAARIO: I was the last to join your army.

751
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,207
I'm not your general
or a member of your Queensguard

752
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,566
or the commander of your Unsullied.

753
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,009
My mother was a whore. I come from nothing.

754
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,003
I will return to nothing.

755
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,847
Let me kill this man for you.

756
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,365
Very well.

757
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,851
You have quite an audience.

758
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,320
Make it worth their while.

759
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,050
He is very brave, Your Grace.

760
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,451
Yes, win or lose,

761
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,609
as long as the whole city is watching.

762
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,330
You sure you don't want a horse?

763
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,051
DAARIO: Why would I want a horse?

764
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,648
Horses are faster than men.

765
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,442
Horses are dumber than men.

766
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,286
I am Daenerys Stormborn.

767
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,246
Your Masters may have
told you lies about me,

768
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,368
or they may have told you nothing.

769
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,965
It does not matter.

770
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,968
I have nothing to say to them.

771
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,523
I speak only to you.

772
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,724
First, I went to Astapor.

773
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,968
Those who were slaves in Astapor,

774
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,607
now stand behind me,

775
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,960
free.

776
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,608
Next I went to Yunkai.

777
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,728
Those who were slaves in Yunkai,

778
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,807
now stand behind me,

779
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,841
free.

780
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,482
Now I have come to Meereen.

781
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,288
I am not your enemy.

782
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,887
Your enemy is beside you.

783
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,322
Your enemy steals and
murders your children.

784
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,644
Your enemy has nothing for you
but chains and suffering

785
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,889
and commands.

786
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,843
I did not bring you commands.

787
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,649
I bring you a choice.

788
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,003
And I bring your enemies what they deserve.

789
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,650
Forward!

790
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,361
Fire!
