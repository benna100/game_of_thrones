00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,248

4
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,163
- You fucking deaf?
- (MAN LAUGHS)

5
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,766

8
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,242

00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,841
- Yes!
- There's a man with an ear.

10
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,685
Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.

11
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,081
First time I saw you with your breeches
down, I thought you were a eunuch.

12
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,521
You've seen it, girls.

13
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,649
Like a baby snail peeking out of its shell.

14
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,967
Your baby was crying this morning.

15
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,290
Woke me up.

16
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,607
- You hear me?
- Yes.

17
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,726
Well, got anything to say?

18
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,768
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,686
(CHUCKLES) I don't care if you're sorry.

20
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,242
Keep that baby quiet, or I will.

21
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,243
Don't you ever touch him.

22
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,281
Little wildling bitch.

23
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,407
You should have stayed with your own kind.

24
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,281
- Are you listening to me?
- Shut your mouth.

25
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,805

It's just an owl, you dumb bitch.

28
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,765
No, it's not.

29
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,090
I should never have left her there.

30
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,645
- You couldn't have known.
- Of course I could've.

31
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,369
They've been raiding the villages close by.

32
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,920
And we just cower in here
while they slaughter our brothers.

33
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,002
Our brothers had orders
to stay at Castle Black.

34
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,081
So it's all right, then?

35
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,687
Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped
to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?

36
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,048
I didn't say it was all right.
I'm saying they shouldn't have been there.

37
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,088
We're pledged to guard the realms of men.

38
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,605
She's dead because of me.

39
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,170
We can't even guard Mole's Town.

40
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,208
We can't go after them. You know that.

41
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,361
It's what they want.

42
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,765
SAMWELL: And little Sam.

43
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,841
As if I cut their throats myself.

44
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,291
Maybe she managed to hide herself.

45
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,245
I thought all of you was dead.

46
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,607
You went up north with Mormont
and no one came back.

47
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,648
Not for ages.

48
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,290
But then you did.

49
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,250
She survived Craster,
and he was the worst shit I've ever met.

50
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,209
She survived the long march to the Wall.

51
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,729
She survived a White
Walker, for fuck's sake.

52
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,445
She might have got out.

53
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,164
She might have.

54
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,530
If they hit Mole's Town,

55
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,523
then we're next.

56
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,288
Mance and his army must be close.

57
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,691
GRENN: 100,000 of them.

58
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,320
And there's what, 105 of us left?

60
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,164

61

How do 102 men stop 100,000?

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,402
be a good lad and burn the rest of us.

64
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,131
Once I'm done with this world,

65
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,364
I don't want to come back.

MISSANDEI: No, not spying.

68
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,727
DAENERYS: The Dothraki think outsiders are
ridiculous taking shame in the naked body.

69
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,009
They make love under the stars
for the whole khalasar to see.

70

Yes, Your Grace.

71
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,321

No.

73
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,365
Well, I don't see why it matters.

74
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,851
Grey Worm isn't interested.

75
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,161
None of the Unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

76
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,643

What?

78
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,647
I believe he was interested.

79
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,322

do they take all of it?

these are precious to I.

- To me.

teaching you the word "precious."

- Why?

Why sorry?

182
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,526
(WHIMPERING)

183
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,927
Are you a woman, boy?

184
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,321
You don't know...

185
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,323
The ironborn will not surrender.

186
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,243
(MUMBLING) My name is Reek...

187
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,644
You go tell your master
that, Theon Greyjoy,

188
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,688
or whoever the fuck you are.

189
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,524
(QUIETLY) Reek.

190
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,921
- What in the hell are you muttering?
- Reek.

191
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,810
Reek.

192
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,689
If we yield, we live?

193
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,445
- Is that what it says on this paper here?
- Yes.

194
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,122
Have your men raise the white flag
and open the gates.

195
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,247
You're going home.

196
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,647
RAMSAY: You didn't really think
I'd let them go, did you?

197
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,523
It's fallen out of fashion, flaying.

198
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,648
Sad, but true.

199
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,722
Traditions are important.

200
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,641
Where are we without our history? Eh?

201
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,805
Yes, my lord.

202
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,682
Will we go home now?

203
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,283
I believe we will.

204
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,328
To our new home.

205
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,490
ROYCE: You have foreign blood,
don't you, Baelish?

206
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,082
A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes.

207
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,844
I suppose all of our ancestors
came from somewhere else originally.

208
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,447
ROYCE: Our forebears settled the Vale
thousands of years ago.

209
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,522
We've fought off invaders ever since.

210
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,208
The beauty of the Vale is matched
only by the nobility of its great families.

211
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,524
Lady Arryn often told me that
you were her rock, Lord Royce.

212
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,729
She told me nothing about you, Baelish.

213
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,167
But I didn't need to hear from her.

214
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,049
Moneylender. Whoremonger.

215
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,243
You've been licking
Tywin Lannister's boots so long,

216
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,129
- it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
- My lord...

217
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,410
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

218
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,802
Always been a grubby job.
Why not let a grubby man do it?

219
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,971
But when I heard you were lurking here,

220
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,681
- fawning over the Lady Arryn...
- Lady Arryn invited me.

221
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,407
She and I have been close since childhood.

222
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,051
Yes, we all know how close you were.

223
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,885
Lady Arryn's predilections
were her own affair.

224
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,610
Her death is our affair.

225
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,445
Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.

226
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,488
She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that.

227
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,721
But suicide?

228
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,090
She adored that boy of hers.

229
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,640
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

230
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,845
ROYCE: Strange that within days
of your arrival,

231
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,888
you've married Lady Arryn

232
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,167
and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

233
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,050
She was always prone to melancholy.

234
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,130
My lady wasn't meant for a world
as brutal as ours.

235
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,929
We were told there was a witness. A girl.

236
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,089
A niece of yours, I believe.

237
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,731
A girl with no learning and scattered wits.

238
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,086
I assure you, she would be of no help.

239
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,969
We'd like to speak with her.

240
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,040
- Let me fetch her.
- ANYA: No need.

241
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,970
We prefer to
hear her testimony unadulterated.

242
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,801
(DOOR CLOSES)

243
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,530
Come closer, child.

244
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,525
You have nothing to fear from us or him.

245
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,361
Lord Baelish here is your uncle?

246
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,726
Your name is Alayne?

247
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,042
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
if Lord Baelish left the room.

248
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,565
- My lady...
- I wasn't asking you.

249
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,687
He can stay.

250
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,728
Speak up, girl,
you're not a damn kitchen mouse.

251
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,801
Tell us what you saw.

252
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,481
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

253
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,050
I have to tell the truth.

254
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,323
I'll tell you everything.

255
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,200
Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.

256
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,325
My name is not Alayne.

257
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,731
It's Sansa Stark,

258
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,766
eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.

259
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,402
Lord Royce,
we met when you came to Winterfell.

260
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,083
You were escorting your son Ser Waymar
to the Wall.

261
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,003
Sansa Stark?

262
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,289
You tell lies right to my
face, you little worm?

263
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,204
Lord Baelish has told many lies.

264
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,002
All to protect me.

265
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,324
Since my father was executed,

266
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,449
I have been a hostage in King's Landing.

267
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,846
A plaything for Joffrey to torture
or Queen Cersei to torment.

268
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,131
They beat me, they humiliated me,

269
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,362
they married me to the Imp.

270
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,522
I had no friends in King's Landing,

271
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,809
except one.

272
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,331
He saved me.

273
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,643
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.

274
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,091
He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie
with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.

275
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,484
But the Lannisters have friends everywhere.

276
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,971
Even the Vale.

277
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,487
He made me swear
not to tell anyone my true name.

278
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,244
Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

279
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,444
ROYCE: Your father grew up
right here in these halls.

280
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,602
We hunted together many times.

281
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,210
He was a fine man.

282
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,130
Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.

283
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,601
You knew her well, my lords, my lady.

284
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,250
She was a troubled woman.

285
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,247
She always loved Lord Baelish.
She told me herself.

286
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,485
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

287
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,281
a boy of eight carrying everything
he owned in a little sack.

288
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,530
She confessed to me
she never loved Lord Arryn.

289
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,047
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

290
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,207
When the gods finally allowed her
to be with Lord Baelish,

291
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,124
she was so happy. For a time.

292
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,768
My aunt was a jealous lady.

293
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,562
She was terrified that
Lord Baelish didn't love her any more.

294
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,564
That he would abandon her
for a younger woman.

295
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,962
And then,

296
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,010
one day she saw him kiss me.

297
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,361
Lady Sansa.

298
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,842
It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce,
nothing more.

299
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,326
Lord Baelish is my uncle now, by marriage.

300
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,609
He's always been so kind to me.

301
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,729
I was so happy to be here, to be free.

302
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,887
All because of him.

303
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,007
But my aunt turned on me.

304
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,129
She cursed me. Called me a whore.

305
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,409
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

306
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,565
When Lord Baelish tried to calm her,
she struck him.

307
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,846
She said she didn't want to live any more.

308
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,002
She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.

309
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,923
He tried to reason with her,

310
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,447
promised her
she was the only one he had ever loved,

311
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,047
but she stepped through those doors
and she was...

312
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,526
(SHUSHING)

313
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,331
It's not your fault, sweet girl.

314
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,248
It's not your fault.

315
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,680
ROYCE: You could see it in the way
she raised that boy.

316
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,684
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

317
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,764
ANYA: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.

318
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,808
Apologies, my lady.

319
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,168
And to you as well, Baelish.
We treated you a bit harshly.

320
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,040
You want justice, Lord Royce.
I can hardly complain about that.

321
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,326
I want the same.

322
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,048
ANYA: Not much justice to be
meted out in suicide, is there?

323
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,407
LITTLEFINGER: For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

324
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,642
Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale

325
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,162
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

326
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,687
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

327
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,003
And since then, Arryn and Royce,
Corbray, Waynwood,

328
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,209
all the great houses of the Vale
watched from the corner.

329
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,726
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

330
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,406
Are you questioning our courage?

331
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,006
I want to know which side you're on.

332
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,970
Do you support the Lannisters, the house
that executed your friend Ned Stark?

333
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,725
Of course we don't support
the damn Lannisters.

334
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,929
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister
for support, and Lysa refused.

335
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,125
By staying out of the fray,

336
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,250
you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy
his rivals on every compass point.

337
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,765
Who stands against him now?

338
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,406
Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?

339
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,244
Robb Stark is dead.

340
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,846
I'd have you back Robin Arryn,

341
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,285
Lord of the Vale.

342
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,647
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.

343
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,008
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

344
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,048
More often they die young.

345
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,726
I adored Lysa with all my heart,

346
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,885
but she loved her son so much
she became overprotective.

347
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,601
He needs to learn how to swing a sword,
how to ride a horse.

348
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,127
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes.

349
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,285
Time for him to tour the Vale,
to visit all the castles in his domain.

350
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,648
Time for Robin to leave the nest.

351
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,849
(GRUNTING)

352
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,844
BOY: Ser Barristan.

353
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,691
Yes?

354
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,011
Who sent you?

355
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,048
- Ser Barristan.
- Ser Jorah.

356
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,884
Have I forgotten a council meeting?

357
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,531
No.

358
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,690
What's this?

359
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,923
A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.

360
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,604
You spied on her.

361
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,241
Who gave you this?

362
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,371
Does it matter?

363
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,482
- Have you told her?
- I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man,

364
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,688
rather than go behind your back.

365
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,610
Let me speak with her in private.

366
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,887
You'll never be alone with her again.

367
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,001
Why did the usurper pardon you?

368
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,690
If we could speak alone.

369
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,883
No, speak to me here.

370
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,803
Explain it to me.

371
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,009
Who do you think sent this to Meereen?
Who profits?

372
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,161
This is the work of Tywin Lannister.

373
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,129
He wants to divide us.

374
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,646
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

375
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,610
The pardon was signed the year we met.

376
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,720
Why were you pardoned?

377
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,087
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

378
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,600
It is not forged.

379
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,609
Why, then?

380
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,409
I sent letters to Varys,

381
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,370
the spymaster of King's Landing.

382
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,090
What was the content of these letters?

383
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,569
- Information.
- What information?

384
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,244
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.

385
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,084
His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.

386
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,283
When you were married.

387
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,203
When your brother died.

388
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,642
You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?

389
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,486
- I...
- Yes or no?

390
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,641
- Khaleesi.
- Don't call me that.

391
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,803
Did you tell him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

392
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,967
Yes.

393
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,521
That wine merchant tried to poison me
because of your information.

394
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,329
I stopped you from drinking his wine.

395
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,448
Because you knew it was poisoned.

396
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,646
I suspected.

397
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,404
You betrayed me

398
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,322
from the first.

399
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,243
Forgive me.

400
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,600
I never meant...

401
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,445
Please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

402
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,603
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

403
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,762
- and stole my brother's throne...
- I have protected you,

404
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,366
- fought for you, killed for you.
- ...and you want me to forgive you?

405
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,525
I have loved you.

406
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,250
Love?

407
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,561
Love? How can you say that to me?

408
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,531
Any other man,
and I would have you executed.

409
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,683
But you,
I do not want you in my city dead or alive.

410
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,888
Go back to your masters in King's Landing.
Collect your pardon, if you can.

411
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,241
Daenerys, please.

412
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,201
Don't ever presume to touch me again
or speak my name.

413
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,124
You have until dusk to collect your things
and leave this city.

414
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,603
If you're found in Meereen
past break of day,

415
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,126
I'll have your head
thrown into Slaver's Bay.

416
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,764
Go.

417
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,804
Now.

418
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,487
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

419
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,050
Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

420
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,803
Walk with me.

421
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,281
Has there been any word from Locke?

422
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,805
No.

423
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,726
Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy.

424
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,726
None of the northern lords have seen them.

425
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,488
Dead most likely.

426
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,409
Most of the ironborn have fled the North.

427
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,280
Now more will follow, thanks to you.

428
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,563
Tell me what you see.

429
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,485
Moors, fields, hills.

430
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,246
Tell me what you see.

431
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,924
Nothing.

432
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,924
Not nothing. The North.

433
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,922
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

434
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,483
400 miles that way.

435
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,730
300 miles that way.

436
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,641
The North is larger than
the other six kingdoms combined.

437
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,041
And I am the Warden of the North.

438
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,361
The North is mine.

439
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,282
Now tell me, what is your name?

440
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,089
Ramsay Snow.

441
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,448
No, not Ramsay Snow.

442
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,125
Open it.

443
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,487
From this day until your last day,

444
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,528
you are Ramsay Bolton,

445
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,490
son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.

446
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,721
(GASPING)

447
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,490
You honour me.

448
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,688
I swear I will uphold your name
and your tradition.

449
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,010
I will be worthy of you, Father,

450
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,844
I promise.

451
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,603
Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.

452
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,281
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

453
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,566
Yes?

454
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,885
(DOOR CLOSES)

455
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,006
First time I saw you,
you were just a child.

456
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,084
A girl from the North
come to the capital for the first time.

457
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,768
You're not a child any longer.

458
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,087
Why did you help me?

459
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,449
They would have thrown you through
the Moon Door if they found you guilty.

460
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,887
That's not an answer.

461
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,250
If they'd have executed you,
what would they have done with me?

462
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,728
I don't know.

463
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,729
Neither do I.

464
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,048
Better to gamble on the man you know
than the strangers you don't?

465
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,971
And you think you know me?

466
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,368
- I know what you want.
- Do you?

467
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,008
ARYA: I thought it'd make me happy,

468
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,122
but it doesn't. Not really.

469
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,884
HOUND: Nothing makes you happy.

470
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,684
- ARYA: Lots of things make me happy.
- Like what?

471
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,410
ARYA: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.

472
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,087
So you're sad because
you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself,

473
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,207
is that it?

474
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,009
ARYA: At least I could have
been there to watch.

475
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,731
I wanted to see the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

476
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,168
Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

477
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,966
You protected him for most of his life.
You think you could have saved him?

478
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,884
I wasn't the damn wine-taster.

479
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,367
Little shit deserved to die, but poison...

480
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,169
Poison's a woman's weapon.

481
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,130
Men kill with steel.

482
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,404
That's your stupid pride talking.
It's why you'll never be a great killer.

483
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,370
I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone
if I had to.

484
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,441
(LAUGHS)

485
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,763
I'd pay good money to see that.

(GROANS)

487
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,809
You should have let me burn it.

488
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,443
It's a fleabite.

489
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,569
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

490
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,002
HOUND: Well, we won't have to walk
too much further.

00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,684
You really think my aunt will pay for me?

492
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,250
Aye.

493
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,084
I've never even met her.

494
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,369
Doesn't matter. You're her blood.

495
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,040
Family, honour, all that horseshit.

496
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,206
It's all you lords and
ladies ever talk about.

497
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,490
I'm not a lady.

Then I offer my condolences.

504
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,441

I've never left home before,
Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.

509
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,800
You shouldn't be.

510
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,089
The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie,
Mother said.

511
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,162
It's not safe outside.

512
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,685
It wasn't safe for her inside.

513
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,730
People die at their dinner tables.

514
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,564
They die in their beds.

515
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,162
They die squatting over their chamber pots.

516
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,402
Everybody dies sooner or later.

517
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,602
Don't worry about your death.

518
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,801
Worry about your life.

519
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,930
Take charge of your life
for as long as it lasts.

520
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,409
That is what it means
to be Lord of the Vale.

Wine always helps.

I thank you for it.

Do you think Oberyn has a chance?

534
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,806
The Red Viper of Dorne.

535
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,121
You don't get a name like that
unless you're deadly, right?

536
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,611
I've never seen him fight.

537
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,411
Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

538
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,927
- Oberyn believes in himself.
- That's putting it mildly.

539
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,002
What's the punishment for regicide?

540
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,970

541
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,441
- Breaking at the wheel?
- Beheading.

542
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,124
Seems rather ordinary.

543
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,441
And he was my nephew as well,
so what is that?

544
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,320

00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,285
On the contrary.

562

Laughing at another person's misery

563
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,883
was the only thing that
made me feel like everyone else.

- For you. You drifted away.

565

I had other interests.

566
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,489
Yes, other interests.

567
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,771
- But I stayed with Orson.
- Why?

568
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,050
I was curious.

569
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,451
Why was he smashing all those beetles?
What did he get out of it?

570
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,163
First thing I did was ask him.

571
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,324
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

572
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,524
He gave me an answer.

573
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,444
"Smash the beetles. Smash 'em."

574
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,806
(GRUNTING)

575
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,844
I wasn't deterred.

576
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,410
I was the smartest person I knew.

577
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,801
Certainly I had the wherewithal
to unravel the mysteries

578
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,087
that lay at the heart of a moron.

579
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,171
So I went to Maester Volarik's library.

580
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,242
Volarik. Tried to touch me once.

581
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,800
Turns out, far too much
has been written about great men

582
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,201
and not nearly enough about morons.

583
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,648
Doesn't seem right.

584
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,566
In any case, I found nothing that illuminated
the nature of Orson's affliction

585
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,450
or the reason behind
his relentless beetle slaughter.

586
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,002
So I went back to the source.

587
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,923
I may not have been able
to speak with Orson,

588
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,731
but I could observe him, watch him

589
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,882
the way men watch animals

590
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,765
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behaviour.

591
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,404
And as I watched,

592
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,051
I became more and more sure of it.

593
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,361
There was something happening there.

594
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,405
His face was like the page of a book

595
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,482
written in a language I didn't understand.

596
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,331
But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons.

597
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,684
And I became possessed
with knowing what they were.

598
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,445
I began to spend
inordinate amounts of time watching him.

599
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,441
I would eat my lunch in the garden,

600
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,204

602
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,244
And when I wasn't watching him,
I was thinking about him.

603
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,368
Father droned on about the family legacy,

604
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,329
and I thought about Orson's beetles.

605
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,131
I read the histories of
Targaryen conquests.

606
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,123
Did I hear dragon wings? No.

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,281

(GRUNTING)

609
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,802
And I still couldn't figure out
why he was doing it.

610
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,362
And I had to know, because it was horrible

611
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,727
that all these beetles should be
dying for no reason.

612
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,290
Every day around the world,

613

Who gives a dusty fuck about
a bunch of beetles?

615
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,202
I know. But still it filled me with dread.

616
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,971
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

617
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,883

618
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,884

and returned to the dirt?

619

620
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,882

621
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,401

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,088

weeping for their shattered little bodies.

He was twice your size.

625
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,569
He just pushed me aside with a "cuhn"
and kept on smashing.
