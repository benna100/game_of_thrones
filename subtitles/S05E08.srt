1
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,892
Your Grace, I want to say...

2
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,461
You will not speak.

3
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,831
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

4
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,800
If only I were otherwise.

5
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,669
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

6
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,272
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

7
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:23,242
You want revenge
against the Lannisters?

8
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,911
I killed my mother
Joanna Lannister

9
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,146
on the day I was born.

10
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:30,782
I killed my father Tywin Lannister
with a bolt to the heart.

11
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,485
I am the greatest Lannister
killer of our time.

12
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,420
So I should welcome you
into my service

13
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:39,158
because you murdered members
of your own family?

14
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,793
Into your service?

15
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,530
Your Grace, we have
only just met.

16
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:47,232
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

17
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,536
If you'd rather return
to the fighting pits,

18
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:53,372
just say the word.

19
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,475
When I was a young man,
I heard a story

20
00:02:56,477 --> 00:03:00,612
about a baby born during the
worst storm in living memory.

21
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,514
She had no wealth,
no lands, no army,

22
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,850
<i>only a name and a
handful of supporters,

23
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:09,388
most of whom probably thought they could
use that name to benefit themselves.

24
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,890
They kept her alive, moving
her from place to place,

25
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,560
<i>often hours ahead of the men
who'd been sent to kill her.

26
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:18,764
<i>She was eventually sold off to some
warlord on the edge of the world

27
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,300
<i>and that appeared to be that.

28
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,968
<i>And then a few years later,

29
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,836
the most well-informed
person I knew

30
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,673
told me that this girl without
wealth, lands, or armies

31
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,843
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

32
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,712
along with three dragons.

33
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,681
<i>He thought she was our best,

34
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:39,484
<i>last chance to build
a better world.

35
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,788
I thought you were worth
meeting at the very least.

36
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,956
And why are you worth meeting?

37
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,724
Why should I spend
my time listening to you?

38
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,293
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

39
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:52,531
You have no one at your side who
understands the land you want to rule.

40
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,633
The strengths and
weaknesses of the houses

41
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,235
<i>that will either
join or oppose you.

42
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:59,238
I will have a very large army

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,372
and very large dragons.

44
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:04,443
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

45
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,711
When I served
as Hand of the King,

46
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,547
I did quite well with the latter
considering the king in question

47
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,517
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

48
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,453
I could do an even better job

49
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,788
advising a ruler worth the name.

50
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,358
<i>If that is indeed what you are.

51
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,327
So you want to advise me?

52
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,531
Very well.

53
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,434
What would you
have me do with him?

54
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:34,606
<i>I swore I would kill him
if he ever returned.

55
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,742
I know.

56
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,016
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

57
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:49,421
Whomever Ser Jorah was when
he started informing on you,

58
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,957
he is no longer that man.

59
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,825
I can't remember
ever seeing a sane man

60
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,561
as devoted to anything
as he is to serving you.

61
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,298
<i>He claims he would kill
for you and die for you

62
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,769
<i>and nothing I ever witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.

63
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,508
And yet he did betray you.

64
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:24,523
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

65
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,358
Yes.

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,460
Many opportunities.

67
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,762
Tyrion: <i>And did he?

68
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:35,901
No, not until forced to do so.

69
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,873
He worships you.

70
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,643
He is in love with you, I think.

71
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,845
<i>But he did not trust you
with the truth.

72
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,513
<i>An unpleasant truth to be sure,

73
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,582
<i>but one of great
significance to you.

74
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:55,554
<i>He did not trust that you would
be wise enough to forgive him.

75
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,589
So I should kill him?

76
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,592
A ruler who kills
those devoted to her

77
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:03,395
is not a ruler
who inspires devotion.

78
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,996
And you're going to need
to inspire devotion,

79
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:10,602
a lot of it, if you're ever going
to rule across the Narrow Sea.

80
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:15,507
But you cannot have him
by your side when you do.

81
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,814
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

82
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,841
<i>( Door slams )

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,487
Confess.

My son.

85
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,760
Let me speak to...

86
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,028
Confess.

87
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,596
I meant it.

88
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,034
My face will be the

My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.

93

<i>When I was eight,
I begged enough money

94

<i>to buy my first
bucket of oysters.

95
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,497

<i>Now every morning,

100
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,009
<i>I make my way
down to the canals.

101

<i>I pass the fish mongers

102
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,186

Lanna is very impressive.

109

Very industrious.

110

She will no longer
turn left onto Ragman Lane.

113

She will turn right
and go to Ragman Harbor.

What will she do there?

115
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,787

It is a strange wager

He only wins
if he loses his life.

146
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:23,782
So why would a captain make
the wager in the first place?

A girl tells a man
that she has seen.

the thin man pays
his family a lot of money.

150
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,698
But perhaps the gambler
loses his bet

151
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,000

have to pay after all.

152
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,968
A destitute woman

what can they do to such a man if
he keeps their money for himself?

for recourse?

A man had no idea what a girl

A girl named Lanna
will return to the docks.

00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:40,151
My concern is that
the Faith does not adhere

179
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,855
to the same standards
of proof as the crown.

180
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,523
<i>I hope you'll excuse me
for saying it,

181
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,860
<i>but belief is so often
the death of reason.

182
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,496
I wish you had said it sooner.

183
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,066
Is there any word from Jaime?

184
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,002
No, I'm afraid not.

185
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,112
Your Grace,
Grand Maester Pycelle

186
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,048
has summoned your Uncle Kevan

187
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,416
back from Casterly Rock

188
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,917
to serve as Hand of the King.

189
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,888
He now presides
over the small council.

190
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,990
Tell him I need to speak to him.

191
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:22,994
I implored him to visit
you, but he would not.

192
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,000
What about my son, the king?

193
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,035
If you can visit me,
then surely the king...

194
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,605
Your arrest and Queen
Margaery's arrest,

195
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,273
the king has not
taken them well.

196
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,441
<i>He remains in his chambers.

197
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:41,279
His servants often find his food
in the hall left untouched.

198
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,213
You need to talk to him.

199
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,116
You need to talk to my son and
tell him to come and see me,

200
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,417
come and see his mother.

201
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,920
He... I tried, Your Grace.

202
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:52,457
He wouldn't see me.
He won't see anyone.

203
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,193
I can't stay here.

204
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:59,497
There is a way, Your Grace.

205
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,969
A way out.

206
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,507
Confess?

207
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,476
To the High Sparrow?

208
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,678
I won't.

209
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,347
I made him.

210
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,016
I rose him up from nothing.

211
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:21,219
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

212
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:24,322
and beg his forgiveness.

213
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,665
Good-bye, my queen.

214
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,335
The work continues.

215
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,639
Why?

216
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,141
Why, Theon?

217
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,345
I'm not Theon.
There is no Theon.

218
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,713
- Reek.
- Reek.

219
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:25,416
Why did you tell him, Reek?

220
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,719
I was helping you.

221
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,253
You wanted to escape.

222
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,523
There is no escape.

223
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,425
Not ever.

224
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:38,262
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

225
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:41,065
The master knew.

226
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,534
He knows everything.

227
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,037
He hunted him and caught him

228
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,239
and strapped him to a cross

229
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,541
and cut away piece after piece

230
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,678
until there was no Theon left.

231
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,450
Good.

232
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:05,690
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

233
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,393
If I could do
what Ramsay did to you

234
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:12,063
right here, right now, I would.

235
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,302
I deserved everything.

236
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,407
I deserve to be Reek.

237
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:26,377
<i>I did terrible things.

238
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,081
Turned on Robb.

239
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,083
Captured Winterfell.

240
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,452
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

241
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,155
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

242
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,057
You've known them
since they were born.

243
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,758
They weren't. They were only...

244
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,360
Only what?

245
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,561
- I can't.
- Tell me.

246
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,329
I can't, not unless
the master says.

247
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,731
- Tell me. They weren't what?
- They weren't...

248
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,600
Tell me why Bran
and Rickon should be gone

249
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,502
while you still breathe the air.

250
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,670
Tell me to my face, Theon.

251
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,639
Tell me that they
weren't your brothers!

252
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,774
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

253
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,446
I couldn't find them.

254
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,254
It was two farm boys.

255
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:16,861
I killed them and burned
them so no one would know.

256
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,200
You didn't?

257
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,636
Do you know where they
went, Bran and Rickon?

258
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,671
I can't talk to you anymore.

259
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,440
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where...

260
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,510
Not Theon! Reek!

261
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,347
<i>( Door closes )

262
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:39,684
Our scouts tell us he's got
no more than 6,000 men.

263
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,253
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

264
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,289
And how high do
Stannis's horses jump?

265
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,692
Our walls have been
fully repaired.

266
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,727
The gates have been reinforced.

267
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,296
We have enough food
for six months.

268
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:56,501
We are more prepared for a
siege than they could ever be.

269
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,737
All we have to do is
wait for them to freeze,

270
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,174
starve, and mutiny.

271
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,611
You disagree?

272
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,313
Stannis isn't from the North.

273
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,281
You are, Father.

274
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:13,784
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

275
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,587
<i>how House Bolton
treats southern invaders.

276
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,755
And what do you recommend?

277
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,457
<i>That we not sit
and wait for Stannis

278
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,293
<i>to decide what sort of
fight this is going to be.

279
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,395
That we hit first and hit hard

280
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,897
and leave a feast for the crows.

281
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:29,433
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

282
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,303
<i>As long as we stay
behind these walls,

283
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,471
<i>they can't touch us.

284
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,839
Not to mention
that the snow is so deep,

285
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,341
we couldn't get an army
through to engage them

286
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,177
even if we wanted to.

287
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,245
I don't need an army.

288
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,948
I need 20 good men.

289
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,790
So, have you decided yet?

290
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:56,394
Whether I'm worthy
of your service?

291
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,731
Have you decided yet whether
you're going to have me killed?

292
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,834
It's probably my safest option.

293
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,239
I can see why
you would think so.

294
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,309
It's what your father
would have done.

295
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,744
And what would
your father have done?

296
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,747
My father,

297
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,916
who publically
sentenced me to death?

298
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:22,553
I'd say his thoughts on having
me killed were abundantly clear.

299
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,689
Is that why you killed him?

300
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,361
Someday, if you decide
not to execute me,

301
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,797
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

302
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,367
And on that day,
should it ever come,

303
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,937
we'll need more wine than this.

304
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,641
I know what my father was.

305
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,610
<i>What he did.

306
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,913
I know the Mad King
earned his name.

307
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,651
So, here we sit.

308
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:57,455
Two terrible children
of two terrible fathers.

309
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,923
I'm terrible?

310
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,925
I've heard stories.

311
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,294
Why did you travel to the far side of
the world to meet someone terrible?

312
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:06,530
- To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
- Which kind is that?

313
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:11,035
The kind that prevents your
people from being even more so.

314
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,504
Well, I did reopen
the fighting pits.

315
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:17,308
Under my rule, murder will once
again become entertainment.

316
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,342
Yes, that was wise.

317
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:22,580
And you agreed to marry someone
you loathe for the greater good.

318
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:24,515
Very impressive.

319
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:27,685
<i>My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,

320
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,954
though not by choice
and certainly not

321
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,390
for the greater good,
gods forbid.

322
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,692
She ended up having him killed.

323
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,896
Perhaps it won't come to that.

324
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,773
It's not impossible that Varys
was right about you after all.

325
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,542
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

326
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:55,680
Yes, he's the one who convinced
me to come find you.

327
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:56,882
He was my travelling companion

328
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,583
before Ser Jorah seized
that role for himself.

329
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,619
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

330
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:05,990
For 20 years the Spider oversaw
the campaign to find and kill me.

331
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,092
He did what he had
to do to survive.

332
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:11,095
He did a lot of other things as
well, things he didn't have to do.

333
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:16,500
<i>I suspect he's the main reason you
weren't slaughtered in your crib.

334
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,336
But you trust him?

335
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:18,969
<i>Yes, oddly.

336
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:23,074
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

337
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:24,542
Except my brother.

338
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,878
The brother
who killed my father?

339
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,746
That's the one.

340
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,815
Perhaps I will have you
killed after all.

341
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,751
Your queenly prerogative.

342
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,887
I had given up on life

343
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,858
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

344
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,594
If you chop off my head, well,

345
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,464
my final days were interesting.

346
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:54,405
I'm not going to kill you.

347
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,009
No? Banish me?

348
00:22:59,011 --> 00:22:59,977
No.

349
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,846
So if I'm not going
to be murdered

350
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,547
and I'm not going
to be banished...

351
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,549
You're going to advise me.

352
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,653
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

353
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:13,924
Advise you on what?

354
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,060
How to get what I want.

355
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,062
The Iron Throne.

356
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,798
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

357
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,068
If I want jokes, I'll get
myself a proper fool.

<i>There's more to the world
than Westeros after all.

How many hundreds of thousands of lives

361
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,945
Perhaps this
is where you belong,

362

363
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,585
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

364
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,655

meant to be bought or sold.

<i>I will continue
that fight here and beyond.

But this is not my home.

When you get back to your
home, who supports you?

368
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,432
The common people.

369
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,534
Let's be generous and assume
that's going to happen.

370
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:59,904
Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the
support of the common people

371
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:02,006
and only the common people.

372
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:06,544
What was that like?
Ruling without the rich?

373
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:07,711
House Targaryen is gone.

Not a single person who shares your
blood is alive to support you.

<i>The Starks are gone as well.

376

Stannis Baratheon
won't back you, either.

380
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:25,162
His entire claim to the throne rests
on the illegitimacy of yours.

381
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,131

And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

387

It's a beautiful dream,
stopping the wheel.

388

You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

389

the Great Pit in front of the queen.

00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:23,988
I won.

about dragonglass.

531
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:10,640
There are old stories about
ice spiders as big as hounds.

532
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,110
And with the things we've
seen, you don't believe them?

533
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:16,513
Jon: <i>Come with me and
I'll share these weapons.

00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:17,581
Come with you where?

535
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,382
Jon: <i>There are good lands
south of the Wall.

536
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,284
<i>The Night's Watch will let you
through the tunnel

537
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,354

00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:27,157
( Murmuring )

539
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,692
I knew Mance Rayder.

540
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,694
<i>He never wanted a war
with the Night's Watch.

541

542

We're prepared
to give you that new life.

543
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:37,634
If?

544
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:42,472
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

545
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,176
Where is Mance?

546
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,282
- He died.
- How?

547
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,388
I put an arrow
through his heart.

548
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,224
- ( Wildlings shouting )
- Tormund: Hey, hey.

549
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,760
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

550
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:06,496
Hey, hey, hey.

551
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,365
Loboda: <i>I say we send

554
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,941
I did.

555
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:20,777
The southern king who
broke our army, Stannis,

556
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,780
wanted to burn him alive
to send us a message.

557
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:28,385
Jon Snow defied
that cunt's orders.

558
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:31,254
His arrow was mercy.

559
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:32,722
What he did took courage.

560
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,491
And that's what we need today,

561
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,293
the courage to make peace

562
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:39,496
with men we've been
killing for generations.

563
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,565
I lost my father, my uncle,

564
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,767
and two brothers
fighting the damn crows.

565
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:47,437
I'm not asking you
to forget your dead.

566
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:50,373
I'll never forget mine.

567
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:55,645
I lost 50 brothers the night
that Mance attacked the Wall.

568
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,615
But I'm asking you

569
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:01,551
to think about
your children now.

570
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,421
<i>They'll never have

No clan can stop them.

The free folk can't stop them.

00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:00,777
He didn't have

586

He came because he needs us

588
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:12,689
